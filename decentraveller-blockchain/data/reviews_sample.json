A cheese plate, which was served with prosciutto, high quality olive oil and bread, followed by a small plate of figs and gorgonzola. The figs were smaller and tougher than I had hoped- they seemed previously dried, not fresh. An artichoke panino came next, which we subbed goat cheese for instead of feta- delicious.

For me, a brownie and a glass of milk is comfort food, but for anyone lacking a database of experience, they might have some fairly wild ideas.  \n\nTurns out, they didn't have a clue and relied on me to order for them.  Okay. I was up for the challenge.  How about a good burger for the 19 year old, and a turkey club for his mother?  Handled.  I've been curious about the chicken & waffles craze, so when I saw it on the menu, I stopped reading.  \n\nWe were all satisfied with our lunches.  The burger was a big hit with the young guy.  He believes burgers are the height of American culture.  He could be right.  Turkey is not well known in China, but the combination with bacon, lettuce, spicy mayo and tomato seemed to captivate my friend.  I moved quickly to remove the long wooden picks used to hold each quarter together, as she was unaccustomed to this shiv and nearly poked her eye out.  \n\nThe fried chicken arrived as a breast/thigh combo with golden brown crispy coat.  It was good, but perhaps a little too salty.  The waffle was the better companion, done well on an iron and still steamy soft within with a hint of sweetness to counterbalance the NaCl on the bird.  As a lover of Southern Fried Chicken, I did not truly appreciate the passionate embrace of these two carb loads on one plate.  Call me old fashioned, but I will stick with waffles for breakfast and fried chicken for other meals; although I might be convinced to change my mind if someone poured pure maple syrup over both and allowed me this sticky indulgence. \n\nJones is a very nice facility with high ceilings, which make the brown sandstone columns around the house quite attractive and draw eyes upward, giving the sense of a mountain lodge in Red Rock, Sedona.  \n\nMade the saying of \"Grace\" seem totally appropriate.", "date": "2015-12-05 22:43:09"}

It is on the National Registry of Historic Places for its size, Corinthian columns, art deco decoration, gold and red paint coffered ceiling, and several innovations in station design - pneumatic tube system and its over-train passenger functionality, which allowed people departing trains under the station to immediately ascend into the station and avoid the soot and smoke of the earlier version locomotives.  I read somewhere that at one time there was a mortuary in the building, chapel, hospital space, and enough room to land a small aircraft.  Can't imagine that.\n\nIt is a beautiful structure as many reviews so well describe.  For me, it is really a museum of American transportation culture that is fully interactive and functional.  In addition to serving the transit needs of millions of people a year on the East Coast, and westward to Chicago and beyond, it offers art (Angel of the Resurrection,1952, by Walker Hancock, and Spirit of Transportation bas wall relief, 1895, by Karl Bitten); and multiple choices of fast and casual cuisine to provide a small measure of comfort to weary travelers. It has found its way into several iconic movies; Blow Out (1981), Trading Places (1983), and Witness (1985).  Seems like it is time for another cinematic experience. \n\n Along with its grander sibling up river, The Museum of Art, it offers spectacular examples of the vision of Philadelphia's City Mothers and Fathers over the past century.  In a city that was once the nation's largest, its capital, and the birthplace of our grand experiment in democracy, it is a living monument to that historic dream. \n\nI was a daily user of 30th Street Station, commuting to/from Trenton for several years. I came to appreciate it as a way station; meeting and becoming friends with people I met every morning, and said \"goodbye\" to most nights. Drinking the same coffee and buying a newspaper before the digital revolution made paper obsolete. Life on a train for a few hours a day is another story, but having this terminus start and end each workday forged a personal relationship with this edifice.  Like any sibling it was not always a lovefest, but I knew it was doing its best to make my commute bearable, if not deeply existential.\n\n But,you don't have to be going anywhere to enjoy a visit.", "date": "2013-10-30 14:32:57"}

First, parking here is TERRIBLE so definitely opt for SEPTA which makes it pretty convenient to get to, and/or a ride share. If taking the trolley or regional rail, it won't drop you off at the Amtrak station fyi. You have to get back up to Market Street and walk around the corner to the large historic building. Now...prior to my trip, I was a bit nervous about being able to navigate the building. I guess I'm used to the craziness that is NYC stations. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the really beautiful architecture that is this building. That's one thing Philly definitely does not lack - is beautiful historic architecture. \n\nThere are plenty food/coffee options and even a very cute flower stand at the corner of the building. Figuring out what to do and where to go is incredibly straightforward and easy. You walk in, see the huge electric board that shows you all the train schedules, which gate and track to go to. The benches you can sit and wait on also have outlets for you to be able to charge your electronic devices, which is really cool. Once boarding starts, you walk down some steps to the tracks, get in your train and on your way. By the time boarding began, the line was super long but got through real fast. If you've got coach class tickets, you basically can sit anywhere marked coach class on the car. \n\nAlso, saw Amtrak ticket stand where you can purchase your tickets, atms, restrooms, and a rental car shop. Didn't utilize any of these but there are options for those who need these services. There were some Amtrak police walking around and an information booth, in case you need help. The station is also very clean for a super busy train station and I thought it looked pretty well-maintained. Glad to have this station so close to where I live - it's a great resource.", "date": "2019-05-01 16:34:35"}

That was nearly 25 years ago when the station, though still beautiful in its faded glory, struggled to maintain its class and dignity in a city that had fallen on hard times. Walking through the grand center hall was like a stroll in an ancient temple paying homage to the greatness of a bygone age. (Please read my earlier review for a flavor of its history.)\n\nThese days the station has been refurbished and renewed beautifully. It has returned to its former grandeur and it could be said it is even better now than ever. The expanded food court is an example of this improvement across the board. The entire south side of the station houses a multitude of fast and fast casual eateries, cafes and bakeries that are as attractive to sit in as their products are tasty to eat and drink. It reminds of the amazing food court that was rebirthed at Union Station in Washington, DC, a few decades ago. \n\n30th Street is now both a high functioning contemporary transportation center and a \"Please Touch\" museum in the heart of America's first capital city. It has become a destination for rail travellers, city dwellers and visitors far and wide. \n\nEven parking has been streamlined and made safe and affordable. Picking up my son coming in from Latrobe on The Pennsylvanian, I was able to park across the street, take the walking bridge to the station using the smooth escalators, and be waiting for him at Track 7 as he emerged from the beneath the station platform, in just minutes.", "date": "2019-12-01 16:29:27"}

This was the best of the four appetizers.\n\nIf we stopped here, Amada would seem like an average three star spot. But it went way uphill with the small plates. First we got Queso de Cabra, which is baked goat cheese, tomato, basil, and almonds. This was delish. I really enjoyed it. Then we got Calamari. This was pretty darn good too. For the last two dishes, my wife and I went our separate ways. She got Coca de Gambas con Garbanzos, which is flatbread with shrimp,\nchorizo, and garbanzo bean pur\u00e9e. i got to taste this dish and it was quite good, but a distant to what I got. Now for the dish that hit a home run. I got Coca de Costillas de Ternera, which is flatbread with beef short ribs, horseradish, parmesan, and bacon. I'm just gonna say, this almost doesn't deserve to be on the same many as the rest of their items. It was so good, so juicy, so tasty, just so amazeballs. This one item made my meal.\n\nWe got a couple of deserts, nothing special, and a bit small. I'm not even going to bother going into details about these.", "date": "2014-10-04 17:48:45"}

Chipotle and Qudoba are American style burrito joints that are about as one note as they get.

So, when I saw a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant arrive to Philly, I was real excited.\n\nThe moment I walked into Wahoo's, it looked just like the Wahoo's out West. I got myself a fish taco and a pork taco, with black beans and rice on the side. And, we got an order of guac and chips to start.\n\nThe chips were nice, warm, and tasty. The guac was pretty good along with it, as was the salsa.\n\nShortly after, my meal arrived. The fish taco was pretty good. The pork taco was bombtastic. The rice and beans were really good as well. Everything tasted so fresh.\n\nWahoo's offer's sit down with full service and walk up service. Even if you do walk up service, they still bring the food to your table. They also have a full bar. The atmosphere is great. Everyone was very nice. At least three people checked in with us to see how our meal was.

I live 4 blocks away from Good Dog, a cozy divey pub that was featured on Food Network's Diner's Drive Ins & Dives.  Great food, top notch beer selections, and entertainment on 3rd floor!  I'm here very often.\n\nBEST food:\n1.  GET A BURGER -  I know you always see \"they have the best burgers\" on every Yelp review you read, but this one holds true.  Really thick burgers, stuffed with oozy blue cheese that totally melts in your mouth.  Ask for SWEET Potato fries, they are much better!  Or, get a mix of 50/50. \n2.  DUCK QUESADILLAS - phenomonal.  Shredded tender duck, with spinach, queso, jack cheese, onions, peppers, and salsa.  Small dish, so you better order something else with it, won't fill you up, but your tastebuds will love you.  \n3.  LAMB BELLY Sandwich - crisp thin slices of lamb belly, and plenty of it.  The sandwhich is stacked!  Topped with roasted tomatoes, onions, arugula, and aioli sauce, this sandwich is a marvelous treat. \n\nGOOD food:\n1.  Flat bread pizza of the day is a winner, and so is the hummus.  \n2. Duck Pot Pie was featured on DDD, and everyone seems to love it, but I personally think its sort of bland.  Its missing that special zing.\n3.  Mac N Cheese is also very good.  Not the best I've had, not the cheesiest I've had, but still good. \n\nNOT good food:\n1.  Octopus salad was way too spicy for me, and although there were several peices of octopus, there really wasn't much else.  The pears and chickpeas were invisible on my salad.  Totally dissappointed in this dish, I left hungry that night.\n\nBesides the food, the craft beer selection is ever-changing.  You can usually catch a few rare draft beers here,  like Russian River.  The good beers kick fast, so I follow them on Twitter where they go first to annouce what beer was tapped.  The service is usually slow, but oh well, the food and beer makes up for it.  There are 3 levels, a bar on 1st & 2nd floor, and pool billiards table on 3rd floor, and darts.   \n\nGo play!  Go drink!  Go eat!

I had the Roasted COD for dinner $26, it comes with mini steamed clams in a very tasty white wine sauce, and grautin potatoes under the fish.  Absolutely delicious!  I would definately order this again.  My friends got the scallops $25, also looked great, but small portions for the price.  The Tuesday special of the Pork Milanese was a huge 10oz size $26, and my friend thought it was very good.

For a french resturant, I was expecting a little more from the Creme Brulee, but it was still good.\n\nOverall, excellent food, fantastic service (sitting inside), and wonderful experience.

The guacamole. Whoever wrote that the serving of guac you get for $8 was too small was insane. It came in a cereal bowl with HOT chips. And as a cilantro hater I was pleased that the guacamole was not doused in cilantro, but perfectly balanced in all respects (especially the chunk factor!).\n\n#2. The passion fruit and mango margaritas. Uh-mazing. I stayed away from the blood orange marg's because that's what I ALWAYS get at every place, ever, and boy I'm glad I did! The passion fruit ones were off the chain.\n\n#3. The tacos. I will admit that I was skeptical...$11 bucks for tacos with sour cream and cheese? Whoa, nelly. I did not expect three gigantic chorizo tacos to come out from the kitchen. Truth be told, I should have only consumed two of the three. But they were so goooooood!\n\n#4. Dessert. Why, you ask, did we get dessert after feeling like we were on the verge of exploding? Well, it sounded good! The chocolate peanut butter bombe was indeed all it was cracked up to be (picture available above).

When she suggested Parc, I initially scoffed, having previously enjoyed this establishment only on the sunniest of days, al fresco dining at it's best.... so I thought. Little did I know what warm, savory comfort foods lay within.\n\nThough, on previous trips, I'd reveled in the warm shrimp salad (an absolute MUST) and cheese plates, this visit I was craving hot, gooey, cheesy and crisp, starchy taters. And Parc, as per, delivered just that, along with a stunning few of a snow-covered Rittenhouse Wonderland. In order to maintain pre-hibernation energy, my buddy and I enjoyed the macaroni au gratin and some french fries, of course. My eyes were drawn to the steaming bowls of french onion soup and, on another day, I'm certain I'll try.... but today, I had my eyes on the prizes. \n\nWe enjoyed a beer (for me) and a boozy cider (for her), as well as some engaging conversation with our server, who was hilarious, quick, and clever. Parc employees seem to always know what to say to make my afternoon/evening better and brighter, and this was no different. \n\nThe macaroni gratin was unreal. I have several friends with whom I regularly discuss the idea of an \"MVM\" (Most Valuable Macaroni) in the city, and while the current leader is Monk's.... I think they're in need of a little day trip to Parc for re-evaluation. The pommes frites are always crisp and well salted, and the pre-meal bread.... well, we certainly got our share of carbs and starches for the day (for the week?) And we both came out as proud members of the clean plate club.\n\nI will say that, on another evening, I was visiting Parc on a more rambunctious day, where the pace was faster and the food was flying. It was on this earlier visit that, due to a waiter to waitress body bump, a carafe of red wine was dumped atop the chambray shirt of one of my dining partners. Not a glass, mind you. This was a butt-load of red wine. And though club soda was rushed over and portions of the meal were comped, the manager also stopped by to offer to pay for the dry cleaning. However, when she visited her dry cleaner and was immediately laughed at since the shirt was what we called \"a lost cause\", Parc purchased her a brand new one. No questions asked.\n\nThe peak of customer service, the zenith of macaroni treats, and the location.... No excused not to park it at Parc.", "date": "2014-01-29 18:06:48"}

Hate to be a follower, but I'll have to add my glowing review to the masses. My partner and I decided to go for a smattering of goodies, getting almost one of everything. Started out with the manchego cheese and a truffled lavender honey, with the heavy hints of lavender being the star of the dish. We were nearly lapping the little bowl clean, and it paired well with the sharp slices of apple and cheese.  Also for our appetizer, the ham croquettes. 5 fried, salty balls of tasty... hard to go wrong.\n\nFor our main dishes, we split the chorizo, grilled shrimp, Escalivada (Roasted Peppers and Eggplant, Cipollini Onions & Confit Tomatoes) and goat cheese toasts, and patatas bravas (spicy potatoes). The only lowlight of the meal was probably the shrimp, which were a little too buttery for me. However, the little skewers of chorizo were succulent and the patatas bravas... hard to go wrong with spiced potatoes and some sort of creamy sauce with a kick (chipotle? I'm sure someone knows.) My partner in dine couldn't get enough of the escalivada, and yet, somehow, we both saved plenty of room for dessert. Chocolate and vanilla versions, my heart went with the pastel de chocolate (Flourless Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Ice Cream & Chocolate-Hazelnut Cara). Plates licked? Maybe a little.\n\nService was attentive, though occasionally my glass tended to stay dry a little longer than I like, especially with such salty dishes. I'll put the blame less on our servers, who were patient and friendly, and more on the fact that it was a Friday during Restaurant Week, and thus (rightfully) mobbed. The bathroom was clean, the soap fragrant, and the paper towels TOP NOTCH for drying even the dampest of hands. And, if you do the math, our meals would've cost about $66 total on a usual week.... for $40 before tip, I'll take that deal any day!", "date": "2012-10-08 00:04:56"}

The old Trestle Inn was a grungy, bonafide El Dive-o strip bar. The dancers weren't the most ladylike creatures at all. They were tough, they had bullet holes and tattoos that they proudly displayed. And you better tip correctly if you catch my drift. With all that said, I hardly ever see women with huge breasts, thick thighs and and a rear end that you could safely put a place setting on and it wouldn't fall off. That and a 22 inch waist is mystical.\nThe newer spot has dancers, but they're the Rowan & Martin variety, it's still entertaining. I'm not a big whisky drinker, but that's all I drink here. After trying a few different ones, I like the cinnamon bomb one and the fire whisky, which is spicy. I guess you can tell I'm not a huge fan of whisky and I'm trying to get better.\nThe atmosphere is great, festive and nice crowd, the flashing lights and cool music adds to the experience.

They straightened me out quick fast and in a hurry. \nMy delivery was prompt and still hot and all the necessary utensils, and sauces and even included a plate. \nThe samosas were delicious, large and stuffed full of meat, the pastry wrap was crisp and tasty. I really liked the fresh spicy salsa on the side.  The garlic naan was toasted just right and after I slathered it with melted butter it was irresistible.\nNow, back to the spice level, when I ordered the chicken tiki masala they offered many spice levels, mild, slightly spicy, moderate spicy, extra spicy to name a few. I chose spicy, which was just below extra spicy.  The dish was good, creamy and hearty chunks of white meat chicken and fresh veggies, the sauce was hot..... hotter than July as Stevie sang. I no longer crave spicy food, they put out my fire with a nuclear spice bomb!\n It left me wondering what extra spicy was like.......\nIt was so spicy, I was comatose for a couple of minutes, when my head cleared I began to feel the burn and the benefits of the spice. My nose, throat and sinus were cleared, my vision was a little sharper, I had to turn down the TV because it sounded too loud and the more I ate, the more heightened the experience got. \nI'm not saying this will happen to you, but I have always been a fan of spicy foods and the reactions I received.

If so, you may want to make a reservation at Modo Mio (yes, even on a Tuesday!) and settle in for a long, delicious Italian meal that'll make your belly pop and your heart sing.\n\nI have had Modo Mio book marked for years, literally YEARS, and after my dining experience on Tuesday, I regret that I waited so long to visit.\n\nZack and I were celebrating Tuesdays, or one month of marriage, or \"What do we do now that we don't have to close on a house or plan a wedding?\" so we decided to go big with the tasting menu. \n\nThe bread, ricotta, and truffled olive oil were DIVINE to start. The bread comes from a massive crusty loaf, and is just chewy enough. For apps I got the mussels in spicy red (broth so good the server brought me a spoon), and Zack got the cured beef with arugula salad. Very good.\n\nPastas were lasagna (heaven) and tiny pea raviolis in brown butter. Like day and night, and I felt lucky to go halvsies on both! Entrees were eggplant with ricotta in a chunky tomato sauce, and Zack got the fish of the day ($5) up charge. I only wish there were more options for main courses. Dessert was simple- flour less chocolate cake (like the fudgiest brownie you've ever had) and a basil panacotta (very unique).\n\n\nThings to note: The portions are not huge, but trust me, you will be rolling out of there after four courses. If you are anti-salt, don't come here. The food wasn't over-salted, but you could DEFINITELY taste it. If you're short on time, don't come here. We arrived at 7pm on a Tuesday and didn't leave until after 9. Make a reservation. They were able to squeeze us in as walk-ins, but the place was packed. \n\nIf you want a romantic, authentic meal- go.", "date": "2014-10-02 14:37:17"}

And, considering my proximity to a veritable cheese mecca, it almost seems silly for it not to be cheese.  So, don't be surprised to see me haunting the fromage counter quite often this year.  \n\nLuckily, the mongers of cheese at DiBruno are not only Pros as far as their cheese knowledge and expertise in suggested pairings, they're also some of the nicest folks out there. Not sure what a cheese is? Ask them, they'll explain (and give you a taste). Trying to compare two different styles for that dreamy cheese plate you're concocting? Let em know, they'll join you in taste testing both.  Just a little peckish before lunch? Grab a taste. Seriously, you don't even need an excuse.  It's wins all-around.  And, the thing is, even if DiBruno was limited only to the cheese counter, I'd be happy as a clam.\n\nLuckily (for all of us), there is so much more. Assorted meats for slicing and charcuterie, prepared EVERYTHING so that you can Picnic in the Park with ease and convenience. Their bakery department is always chock-full of carby goodness, and the desserts.... oh baby. Chocolates to please any palate, sweet cupcakes and cannolis, you could just ogle for days.

It was recommended to me by several friends!  I finally made a trip up to NoLibs over the weekend to hit Jerry's Bar on a Saturday night.  I was pleasantly surprised upon walking in, such a warm inviting atmosphere of a cool gastropub.  The bar seats were all taken, so we were seated at a table near the bar.  There's also an entire patio out back, with tons of outside seating that is enclosed inside a patio with cool lighting and a second bar.  That was impressive!\n\nThe food was amazing.  We originally came for drinks, but after seeing the glorious options on the food menu, we quickly changed our minds.  We ordered:\n1. Trio of Dips - really good! Fresh feta, pickled cucumbers, hummus, red pepper hummus, olives, beets, and a delicious tzatziki.\n2.  French Dip - a HUGE sandwich overflowing with meat and cheese. This was so delicious, especially when dipping in the au jus. \n3.  Gnocchi - with goat cheese and sweet potatoes, this was also amazingly delicious! \n4.  Cream cheese doughnuts for dessert was good, and the chocolate dipping sauce made it even better. \n\nThe drinks were also really good!  We had several vodka cocktails with creative mixers that were specialties on the menu.  We also tried a champagne drink and a gin drink from the menu.  For once, I didn't order beer, since the drink menu seemed more interesting than their current beer selections.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because a combo of a few small, relatively unimportant things:  cocktails were steep at $10 each,  one bathroom stall could cause problems on a busy night, our waiter didn't seem very thrilled to be there, although it didn't seem to bother us too much because he was still quick.  Overall, fantastic bar!  Highly recommended.", "date": "2014-10-21 01:01:17"}

YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST FINE!), the picky palate, or the range of appetites (from the hungry hippo to the folks just in it for the booze and mezze plates), Zahav has you covered. And while you COULD just be in it for the incredible wine list or an incredibly refreshing lemonnana cocktail, I'd instead recommend that you show up hungry and open-minded. You will only leave with joy in your heart.\n\nDefinitely don't skip the Salatim, an ever-changing selection of salads that have so much variety, flavor, color, and texture diversity that it's a culinary rainbow for all of the senses. Their hummus, no surprise, is killer. But you shouldn't fill up on it (don't worry, they are generous with to-go containers) because the courses only improve from there. I've gone for restaurant week (which you can recreate with their Tayim option for $42 any day of the year) and, most recently, to taste their Mesibah option of the roasted lamb shoulder. \n\nThere has not been a bite of food I haven't raved about to friends, strangers, servers, and the internet. Standouts to me include: crispy haloumi (DON'T YOU EVEN THINK OF SKIPPING, REGARDLESS OF DIETARY RESTRICTIONS!

I fell pretty hard for the lamb merguez... that said, if you can round up some buddies for the Mesibah lamb shoulder, don't hesitate to call ahead and tell them you're interested. It's one of the most perfect meats I've ever consumed, and the leftovers have served me well for three meals after. I honestly almost forget the desserts I've tried because my mind was swirling so quickly after dinner.... But, ya know, they've done no wrong for me to-date, so just ask for a recommendation and eat the heck out of it.\n\nI will jump at any (or no) excuse to come here.

There was some tasty pork as well.\n\nBy now I was busting out of my pants. We nixed the salad. There seemed to be no point. Desert was happening, and is part of the deal. They brought out four different deserts for us to share. This was my OMG moment. There was a chocolate cake, a cheesecake, and a couple of other cakes, which I am drawing blank on at the moment - I mean I was almost in a food coma at this point.

I am not sure that I would get the tasting menu again, only because we left so much food uneaten (I would have loved to have taken food home, but we had a long night of  being out afterwards without storage).\n\nSALADS AND HUMMUS:\nThe selection of salads were terrific, very tasty.  I liked the beet salad and the eggplant ones best.  The hummus was well made.  The salads, hummus, and pita would make a good meal in their own right if you got a bit more pita.  For the amount of salads and hummus you get, there needs to be either more pita or less other stuff.\n\nWe were sent out a complimentary dish of smoked salmon and some pickled vegetables.  The pickling on this was too strong for my taste, I did enjoy the smoked salmon though.  It seemed like every table was given a complimentary dish.\n\nSMALL PLATES:\nThe haloumi and dates might have been my favorite of the small plates, very rich flavor.  \nThe duck hearts were not too tough, were well seasoned and paired well with what was on the plate.  \nThe asparagus was cooked well, well seasoned and flavorful.\nThe last of the small plates was sort of a breaded chicken ball.  It had what might have been rice or couscous inside with some small vegetables.  This was a little dry.  \n\nGRILLED DISHES:\nThe branzino was served with tzatziki, lemon, and a crispy skin.  My companion liked the fish more than I did, the citrus taste was a bit much for me.  I thought the lamb was delicious.  The peas worked perfectly with the earthy taste of the meat. \n\nFor dessert, she had the pineapple sorbet, I had a carrot cake with apricot.  We both agreed that mine was the better of the two.  A moist cake with apricot baked into it.  \n\nDINNING ROOM AND SERVICE:\nI was surprised how loud it was in here.  Tall ceilings, tables close together.  There was a not-so-dull roar until it got pretty late into the night.  The music was interesting, surprising for what we were doing, but great music.  \n\nThe service was impeccable.  However, I am not a big fan of the over the top service in places like this.  I don't need new silverware every minute and a half, and my water glass was refilled even when I didn't drink out of it.  I did like that we arrived early for our reservation and were seated as soon as we walked in, I was not expecting that.

I tried to get reservations there for Valentine's Day, but a month in advance was not quite enough for such a busy occasion.\n\nMy wife planned a surprise dinner for my birthday. I knew we were going, but not where we were going. At some point, Zahav crossed my mind because it was a destination my wife knew I wanted to go to, but had not made it to yet. But, not one to beat up on guessing the outcome of a surprise, I let it go.\n\nPrior to dinner, we planned to see a movie. Originally, I was going to choose the 300 sequel at out local theater. A few days prior, I realized The Grand Budapest Hotel was playing at one of the artsy Ritz theaters, which just happened to be a stone throw away from Zahav.\n\nAs we were heading to the theater, that feeling about Zahav entered my sphere once again. I made a joke about Zahav to my wife, who had to use all of her will not to give it away. I played it cool, not allowing my feeling to spoil the surprise.\n\nAfter the move, when the surprise became real, I mustered up some surprise, but the idea of any sort of shock was gone. But surprises are overrated anyway. My wife chose well, and that's what matters.\n\nTo say it was a fantastic meal is an understatement. It was mind numbing good. We did the pre fixe menu which allowed us to really feast at a very reasonable price of $39 per person.\n\nFirst the homemade pita bread with humus and an array of salad items came. The bread was near perfect. The humus was the best I ever had. The other salad items were all delish.\n\nThen, one at a time, came out the first four small plates. The Yam dish was very yummy. The squash dish as well. Another item seems to be escaping me right now. But the one dish I will never ever, ever, ever, forget, the dish that must have been sent to us by the Gods, is the Fried Cauliflower. I quivered after my first bite of this goodness. I want this to be a part of my last meal. Even better, part of every meal, since I might not know when my last meal is, and, well, who cares. I just want to eat it, eat it some more, and just not stop eating it.\n\nI could lie and continue to over hype the Fried Cauliflower by claiming the rest of the meal was a bit of a fog, because the Fried Cauliflower was that good, but the meal continued to blow my mind.\n\nThe last two dishes were the chicken and kofte.

I made reservations 2 weeks in advance, only way to seat a party of 6 during normal dinner hours.  Use OpenTable for reservations, they are the best.  \n\nWe had a great experience.  We all had the tasting menu, $39/person, which comes with Laffa Hummus, 2 Mezze's, 1 entree, 1 dessert.  Everything is tapas style small plates and served to the table to share, but you certainly get alot of food ,we were all so stuffed we couldn't finish the plates.  Best part was the hummus and apps, the main courses were not as stellar.  Desserts were great.  Wine was overpriced.  Service was great, but the entire meal took nearly 3 hrs which was exhausting, and I was ready to leave!\n\nI will come back, but for several different hummus plates and apps.  No more wasting time on the main meals.  Hummus was to DIE FOR, and so were nearly all of the apps.  Also, drink ahead of time, the prices on wine & mixed drinks are too much.  $12/ glass wines, cheapest bottle is $50, mixed drinks $12+.  Beer is fine at $5 ish a bottle.\n\nBravo chef.

We were taken for our reservation on-time, our courses came out quickly, our waitress (Marie) was outstanding (as was the rest of the staff that bussed our table, filled our water, brought our bread, etc.), and the food was spectacular. I really have no complaints about this - except to say that I was glad we were not seated in front of the door because it got stuck open every time someone new came into the restaurant. Not to mention that the price is definitely right here... a four-course meal for two people only cost $113.00. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what I ate in order from my favorite to my least favorite dish:\n\n1. Spinach and ricotta dumplings with a nutmeg brown butter. This was my favorite dish by far. The dumplings were essentially little gnocchis (the texture and heavyness was the same), but the butter sauce was SO GOOD. Guuuuhhhh I just want another plate of these right now.\n\n2. The mussels in a white wine sauce were my second favorite dish because they were the biggest mussels I've ever eaten in my life. Seriously. \n\n3. Crispy pork tenderloin with beet and horseradish salad. This was essentially a pork cutlet (breaded) with beets on top. I didn't get much horseradish in this dish, but I liked it and was surprised how nicely the beets paired with the pork (I'm not a beet person).\n\n4. Butternut squash ravioli with pancetta and sage. These were definitely good, but they were sweeter than I was expecting, so it's primarily for that reason that they come in a little lower in my ranking.\n\n5. Veal with a mushroom cream sauce. This was good - it reminded me of a cross between beef stroganoff and veal Marsala. \n\n6. Italian festival sausage with lentils and a balsamic poached egg. This dish was basically a crispy piece of sausage on a bed of lentils with an egg on top. I don't really like poached eggs or lentils, so that's why this is last (and also why my husband was the one to order this for himself!)\n\nFor dessert we got a flourless chocolate cake and something else that I can't remember the name of. It was basically a white cake soaked in sambuca stuffed with ricotta cheese and some chunky bits that I can't decide were dried grapes or walnuts and then covered in a hard shell chocolate ganache. I liked both desserts a lot and was stuffed by the time we left. I would absolutely go back here!", "date": "2013-01-02 13:02:43"}

Our server went over the RW menu ( which is pretty much the regular tasting menu just 4.00 cheaper).\n\nWe all decided silently on food options and when it was our turn to order we proudly stated our options ranging from duck hearts to foie gras. We would probably share but no one knew for sure.\n\nThe first to arrive were our drinks and hummus alongside a trio of salads. My favorite was the beets. It's very strange how ones palate changes I never thought I would  want to SMD in those beets but it did. The hummus at Zahav is better than any other restaurant hummus I've had so far world wide. I would love to know the secret to this magical spread.\n\nA second round of bread was brought out for our dipping pleasures. Courses came out in a a staggered way which have everyone a chance to dive in and share. My favorites were the grilled haloumi, the b\u00eate salad and the mackerel.\n\nAs food came out conversations slowed down and we enjoyed all the extras sent out by the kitchen . I was too full to enjoy my entire dessert but I took at least one bite from all the options offered and the French press coffee made this such an enjoyable dining experience .

The drinks arrived but they were yellow and less delightful. When we asked the waitress what the deal was, she explained that the drinks change month to month, so the Miss August we previously experienced had changed. This was fine, totally our misunderstanding. There was no offer of a  different drink, weird for customer service, but understandable. Not ones to let alcohol go to waste, we reluctantly suffered through them to get them out of the way and ordered the Pink Lemonades, much more our speed. For food, I ordered the pulled pork tacos and dining partner ordered the lobster roll special. Both were really good, especially his lobster roll. The pulled pork in my tacos was super juicy and drippy-YUM. The tortilla itself was disappointing, lacking flavor. Maybe it needed salt? Who knows.

The bartenders are nice, and very knowledgeable about the beer.\n\nThere is about 20 taps here, always rotating and they always have several selections of \"heavy hitters\" with 10%+ ABV.  You will always find something rare here.  Also, if you're not a beer drinker (sorry for you!), J/K, they also have several kinds of specialty house mixed drinks that are delicious.\n\nVarga bar is certainly one of my favorite local spots in the city, to drink a rare craft beer, eat some dollar oysters, and chow down on amazing food.  Hell, I love this place so much that I bought the t-shirt!", "date": "2013-09-09 03:07:50"}

This worked out so well that, when presented an opportunity to complete a participant observation exercise for a grad school class, I opted to observe the Varga patrons and staff instead of the local coffee shop. Here is what I turned in to my professor (I got an A).\n\nI visited Varga Bar at 5:30pm-6:20pm Thursday, June 6th, 2013. It was overcast with a few drizzles outside, but not enough to prevent folks from dining al fresco. The outside looks clean and is maintained nicely (impressive considering the white brick). I imagine that some folks are drawn in simply because of the appearance. The open-window style is very appealing, and the fact that people were sitting outside despite the slight drizzles shows that it's clearly a hot spot to be.\n\nVarga Bar seems to be a \"cool\" spot for families, young professionals, local beer aficionados, and everyone in between. They have a great deal during happy hour, and the space is comfortable and kitschy with the whole pinup theme. The staff definitely seems to have a solid relationship with each other, giving a friendly vibe to the establishment before you even interact with anyone.  The crawfish boil experience, while not novel or new to me (since I've been living in the South for a while), seemed to draw in a number of people wanting to try something new, and I saw faces both light up and look very confused when the crocks were brought to their table. Philly Beer Week can bring people to new locations that they might not usually visit otherwise and that may also have been breathing some new life into the happy hour period of time. It was a comfortable scene, and one that I plan on recreating soon (though hopefully without the notepad and pen).\n\nThe inside was very comfortable though, at times, a tight squeeze for the employees to get past the patrons (always at the expense of the employees comfort/time, though, never an issue for the patrons). There were paintings of pinup girls on the ceiling and a few posters on the walls, and it had a very put-together feel, the whole restaurant/bar going along with the theme. The kitchen's location was unobtrusive to all but maybe the very last booth in the back, and even then only when the servers were bringing things back. The lighting was definitely more \"bar\" like than simply restaurant, without being dingy but definitely a little dimmer than I'd expect from a mere restaurant.\n\nThe employees all seemed to fit into the at-times-cramped space and move like a well-oiled machine. There were no arguments that I overheard, and no complaints from the customers regarding timing or service. I think that this was not a normal night at Varga due to the crawfish boil taking place. However, I noticed with the friendly atmosphere and comfort that many patrons seemed to have that it felt like \"business as usual\". As it was Philly Beer Week, it's likely that there were more people there for beer than food, though a number of folks seemed drawn in by the novelty of the crawfish. Stopping by around happy hour, I was bound to come across all different types of people from post-work relaxers to families to buddies just grabbing a drink and starting the weekend off early. I thought it was funny that the one person I observed eating a meal from start to finish took a photo of his food, because I definitely caught a number of other people doing the same thing.", "date": "2013-07-03 23:25:54"}

That's it. FIVE. Out of FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE.\n\nI consulted with Vinny P. and Rebecca S. before ordering this hush-hush burger, and I'm sure glad I did. The Percy burger might be one of the best burgers I've had the pleasure of eating in Philadelphia. Talk about underrated! \n\nIt's like the best homemade burger you've ever made on your grill, times a thousand. Soft, perfectly cooked-to-medium ground brisket, a slice of cheddar, a compact bun that fit in my palm and didn't break once, pickles and onions. No puddle of grease or pit in my stomach at the end. Just $11 (yeah, it's kind of a lot for a burger with no sides) of pure beef bliss. \n\nFun fact: on your birthday you get to spin the wheel by the jukebox, and maybe win a coozy or a beer or a slice of pecan pie.  Pecan pie FTW. If you don't like pecan pie (you're crazy), the key lime is to die for. Really. \n\nOther great stuff: BBQ chicken, the \"Lockhart\" in general, the pork belly sandwich (Zack's fave). The macaroni and cheese.\n\nPass on: the apple citrus salad. Pretty small and with weird flavors. Too much pepper and olive oil for a sweet salad.

The pork had a deep meaty-fatty flavor and was juicy.

While it isn't what I would consider a traditional barbecue dish (it's a little fancy for all of that), it has my praise. This dish definitely gave the pulled pork a run for it's money. \n\nSIDES: portions could have been larger, not enough in a serving to share between a table.\n\nThe cole slaw worked perfectly with the pork, it was drier (which I like) and a sweet slaw.  I would order this by the pound to take home. \n\nThe German potato salad was good, not the best I've had, but pretty damn good. Potatoes were soft, taste had some tang to it.\n\nThe collard greens were alright.  They were soft, but did not have as much of a meaty flavor as I'd have liked.  They lacked sweetness, spice, or smoke.  Fairly bland.  Not terrible, but lacking from what I'd hope for.\n\nSAUCE:  The three types available are hot, mild and sweet.  The hot was my favorite.  It was a slow burn that sneaks up on you.  It wasn't incredibly hot, so I think most wouldn't need to be wary of it.  The hot had a good flavor to it as well.  \n\nDRINKS: Pretty good list of beer and spirits, especially bourbon and rye (as it should be).

He really did a great job and seemed like he was genuinely enjoying himself. \n\nSeveral dessert flights were ordered and they were all very good.  The s'mores, liquid chocolate cake, and peanut butter/chocolate were table favorites.

The beans were good, still had some stiffness to them (which I prefer).\n\nI really dig the homey look of this place.  It reminds me of Christmas when I was little, with tables and chairs stuffed into every corner to accomidate the number of people who will be attending.  I didn't mind at all that our party of two were stuffed into a corner where we had to move the table to get up, in fact it added to the charm and intimacy of the place.\n\nService was attentive and friendly. \n\nWe ordered a couple of cocktails with dinner, a Pimm's Deluxe and Nosey Parker.  Their signature cocktails tend towards the sweet side, next time I'll likely order something simpler.", "date": "2013-07-23 21:49:57"}

My dining partner and I walked in around 11am on Sunday morning and were seated almost instantly. This was pleasantly surprising due to the fact that the place was packed and many groups of 3+ were waiting to be seated. The service was excellent with quick, attentive, and friendly servers. I ordered the breakfast burrito sans mushrooms while my dining partner ordered the French Toast topped with fresh fruit and a side of whipped cream. Both were fantastic and priced under $10.

This has it's charm with high ceilings and exposed pipes and ducts, and large photos of the local buildings in black and white that are strong suggestions of it's history. \n\nOn Saturday morning it was packed with a 20 something crowd enjoying Rival Bros Coffee and a short, but tasty breakfast/lunch menu. Hard walls make for poor acoustics, and the din was several decibels above comfortable. But, everyone was friendly and dealing with the racket. Even the queue to the single restroom had cool people who understood the situation and willingly chatted with their line mates.\n\nOur table wait was about 25 minutes, but we made it to a small deuce in the middle of the room, with people on either side. It was tight, but the ambient noise allowed for privacy. The menu was divided into brekkie and lunch on either side of the document. I went with the chicken salad wrap, and DT opted for their burger. Both we're good. The burger seemed hand packed which gave it a softer texture and more retained juices. I prefer a more chunky chicken salad, but had no negs about theirs. We were drinking the house java, which was hot and kicky, but served in small white cups that needed refilling after a couple of gulps. Larger joe vessels would have been more efficient for the staff and felt more generous to the customers. \n\nCafe Lift is a very interesting place to hang out. The room is really humming and the staff works hard to please.

Please, if you can, request Rich as your waiter at The Franklin. Tell him what you like in a drink and he'll surprise you with the most elaborate cocktails, on the menu and off. In fact, that's what we did all night. \"Rich, I like rum and fruit. Whaddya got?\" \"Rich, I like whiskey and bitters. Whaddya got?\" \n\n\"I'll have that!\" was probably the most frequently used phrase of the evening. \n\nMy group was also given a collection of snacks.

After 5pm, you can head down the stairs for a loooong menu of skewers and sushi. \n\nBut for lunch (and that's 10pm-3pm), the menu is pleasantly streamlined: pick a protein (steak, shrimp, pork, chicken, tofu, meatball) and what form you would like it in (salad, banh mi, rice, noodles) in exchange for $7.\n\nI do like a salad with minimal leaves and lots of herbs. South East Asia gets it. The Double Knot lunch salad is mostly citrusy cabbage, daikon, mint and cilantro.  Four lightly fried, plump shrimp came with it. It could work as a light lunch or shareable lunch appetizer.\n\nI remember a few years ago when Sampan offered lunch, specifically the high quality banh mi they served. Double Knot brings it on back with a fresh baguette that doesn't hurt the jaw (some banh mi bread does!) and nicely marinated steak that steals the show.

It's the epitome of comfort food with plenty of fried and flavorful options and very nice service (sounds like we had the same server as Melissa P.!), as we definitely picked a Ben's brain about his favorites and what we should get as a group of 4.\n\nLoved the Nashville buns: totally flavorful and spicy! The Fried Cheese Curds were also delicious (along with their two dipping sauces, one quite smokey), though I wouldn't liken them a mozzarella stick, as some have--they have more of the texture of fried tofu with that outer skin rather than breadcrumbs. Unfortunately by the time I got to my actual \"main course\" order (fried chicken with biscuit and pickles), I was pretty full. The chicken was extra crispy, which was nice, but definitely took second place to the buns in terms of flavor. The biscuit was lovely and the jalape\u00f1o cornbread was divine! Knowing I was going to be too full for a heartier dessert, I ordered the honey grapefruit sorbet. Having grown up with homemade grapefruit sorbet, I found Bud and Marilyn's a little too sweet for my taste--I love the zing of grapefruit; however, a fellow diner who doesn't like grapefruit enjoyed it, so maybe it's meeting the two worlds in the middle? The taste of chocolate peanut butter mousse (visually much like their salted caramel budino) was fantastic: I could totally see hunkering down with one at a movie fest and loving every bit of it!

And my birthday friend as well.  We both were very impressed with how delicious everything was! You know when you take a bite of something, and its so good, you just look at each other with a mouthful of food and go \"Mmmmmmmygod!\"  Well that was everything we ate at Bud & Marilyn's. \n\n- CARROT appetizer stole the show. Our favorite dish of the night, was like artwork on a plate, and tasted even better! There was an amazing yogurt sauce, and everything else on the dish was perfection to my taste buds. Best carrot dish I've ever eaten! \n- Nashville HOT BUNS were also really good. The buns were delicious, and although I don't like spicy food, I gobbled this down easy and loved it. \n- SCALLOPS main dish was amazing. It was larger than I expected, with tasty corn cakes sandwiched in between the scallops. Very tender and juicy, the orange sauce didn't overpower the delicate scallops. Everything was just right. \n- Side order of some local GREENS was our least favorite, but still very good. \n\nSave room for dessert, seriously. Don't skip dessert!  We sat at the salad/dessert chef's counter so got to see each dessert prepared, and damn they were superior. We ate the Birthday confetti Cake, which sells out quick! It sounds simple, but the coconut icing layered in between that funfetti is fantastic and tasted sooo much better than I anticipated.  We also ate the chocolate MALT BALL cake, which is layered with a thick, rich, peanut butter filling. I would have liked more malt flavoring in the chocolate cake, instead of just malt balls on top, but the peanut butter layers was rich and delicious. The ELVIS dessert looked the best, I have to try that next! Also the lady behind the counter said her favorite was the coconut cream pie, which also looked mind blowing. FYI, these cakes are MASSIVE, so be prepared. \n\nI can't wait to come back here, everything was absolutely delicious and really blew us away! One of the best dinners I've had in a long time!

I don't think they are as good as Banana Leaf, but this isn't something that you often find, so I'd recommend it.  \nOf the starters that we ordered, I think the best was the Nashville buns.

You could taste the vegetable instead of just cream.  \n\nI tried two entrees: The pork chop and the Tout special that they had that day.  The pork was a thick chop, with a sweet and tasty sauce on top of greens and grits.  This is a great, home style dish.  \nThe trout was served with brussel sprouts, bacon, and barley.  This dish worked well, and deserves a spot on the menu.  The brussels, bacon, and barley would make a great dish even without the fish.\n\nThe two drinks that I tried were well made.

Three cheeses, red onion, bacon, poblano crema (and, of course, chicken tinga. This dish is savory, crunchy, cheesy, rich, and exciting. \n\nOurs was initially forgotten by our waitress.

I stuck to sparkling water. \nSome Brussels sprout special that was excellent. \nBeet salad: best best salad I've had yet! I wanted another one immediately!\nSpeck and egg pizza: this was amazing.

There are like 300 bottled beers, some really rare stuff you can't find anywhere else.  There's also ever-changing kegs in both front & back bars, so you can go several times and have different beers on tap each time.  \n\nThe food is amazing.  The mussels are delicious, several different kinds.  The veal cheeks are my favorite, the meat literally melts in your mouth!  Never had anything like it before.  I've also had the pulled pork, fish, steak, frog legs, burgers, so many dishes and I've loved everything.  Never gotten a bad meal here, or bad service.\n\nThe waiters are all cool as hell, they are very knowledgeable about the beer menu, so ask for suggestions!  The bartenders are also wonderful, so ask them for help too!  Your experience here will be the best if you're not intimidated by the beer menu, and ask for suggestions.\n\nOnly draw-back is its ALWAYS crowded.  Getting a seat at the bar is unlikely, especially on weekends.  However, there's a reason why its always crowded, and that's because everyone knows this place is the BEST.  No kidding.

What a perfect dessert! The foamy chocolate isn't too overpoweringly chocolatey, if you know what I mean, the maple custard and drizzled maple syrup is just smooth and creamy and divine, and the bacon chocolate crunchies added texture and the rarest hint of bacon, which was perfect--I wouldn't want my dessert to taste solely of bacon! The rest of the desserts were also highly appreciated: fluffernutter crullers (poached blackberries, peanut butter, cream cheese fluff), blueberry coffee crumble (strawberries, peaches)--not too sweet, which was refreshing!, and sour cream panna cotta (poached cherries, lemon curd, meringue)--the lemon curd made this dessert (I find panna cotta on its own rather blah).\n\nWill definitely return for Abe Fisher's usual pre-fixe meal, and (if I got out of work in time) its happy hour specials: $7 for all cocktails and their first course dishes, $5 for a trio of open-faced sandwiches (1 vegetarian, 1 meat, 1 fish).\n\n*I ask you, why do I not have the pickling recipe Abe Fisher, Zahav, and Dizengoff use for their veggies?!

I mean, we were seated next to two men who clearly had just gotten off a construction site, and they couldn't even finish the heaping piles of fries that were left on their plate.\n\nThat being said, the food was to die for.

Only drafts. \n\nSo, yes, the beer is phenomenal.  The food is also just as good.  I had the asparagus app, which had a charcoal grill taste, delicious!  I also ordered the duck confit flatbread, with fig and foie gras... again, so delicious.  The menu had so many good options, very similar to other Trias.

This food is absolutely delicious, service is top notch, so I have to give a 5 star rating.

Seriously though, the food is worth it, but you don't have to splurge as much as my group did. \n\nWe got the $65 tasting menu, which comes with basically one of everything, and the large massive Montreal style short ribs. The man of our group was nervous all the small little plates would not be enough for him, but he was pleasantly surprised. We actually had so much of the main course left over, we had a huge take-away box full of short ribs left. \n\nThe meal started with these delicious tiny toasts, complimentary. The apps from the tasting menu, we chose were: beef carpacio (so delicious!), potato latke with smoked salmon (also amazing), pickled white fish/ makaral maybe (my favorite), and one other dish I forgot. But everything was so good that we were scraping up the last bits of sauce from the plates. We were even gifted the liver, compliments of the chef. It sounded to risky for us, but the server insisted we try it because it was so good, so we got it for free :) He was right, it really was delicious!  The caesar salad app was also fantastic. Seriously, everything was fantastic. \n\nThe short ribs were presented to us still on the bone, once they were almost done cooking, so we could see the size. Then they took it back to finish the cooking, sauces, and slicing it up on the plate. It was perfectly cooked, about medium rare, so tender and full of flavor. Too bad we were too full to finish half of it! \n\nI will come back to Abe Fisher anytime. Next time, I won't splurge on the most expensive tasting menu. Maybe I'll try a few a la carte items like the tacos that I missed from the 3rd course. Overall, fantastic food, and incredible service.

Options range from flat breads, wings , ribs and a few dips sprinkled in. I think everyone will have options here if dining. I opted for the garbanzo pur\u00e9e to accompany my two glasses of wine. It had a slight spice and came  inside a jar layered with feta and roasted peppers. The grilled flatbread served along side it was chewy and still crisp, exactly how I like my flatbread to be. It was the perfect dinner and very filling and well priced at 6.00 for the jar. \n\nThe atmosphere is still very tria awesomely seductive , with low lights and instead of candles there are  lots if industrial lights scattered throughout. \n\nThere's plenty of seating along a 8-12 seat bar and a few high top chairs, the back space has a few high top tables and a long bench that would be  perfect for a crew the size of the former team fun. \n\nI think this tria tap room is a great addition to this neighborhood and though i lost my favorite gayborhood tria manager Chris I can visit him a little closer to work at Tria Tap room.\n\nGo . sip .

I was confused about the chips on the dish, but they added a very nice crunch to the dish. \n\nThe Brussels Sprout Caesar was served with slivers of almonds and pumpernickel croutons.  The ceasar dressing pairs with the brussels sprouts and the pumpernickel very well.  Delicious. \n\nThe smoke in the Salmon Crudo and the pickled flavor were very good.  It mixed well with the apple, jalapeno, and cheese to not be overbearing.  A well constructed dish. \n\nCorned Beef Tongue: I was a little worried about the sauerkraut in this dish, because that flavor can be too intense for me, but this was a mild sauerkraut and the tongue was very good.  It reminded me very much of a dish that my better half grew up with.  A terrific dish, lot's of flavor.\n\nI couldn't get over the leeks in the Challah Crusted Tilefish.  The leeks and the broccolini paired very nicely with the fish, I also really enjoyed the crispness of the crust on the fish. \n\nCholent Pot Pie: one of the best pot pies that I've had in a long time.  I wish some of the ingredients were chopped a little smaller, but the flavor was amazing.  The meat was fatty with that delicious sticky flavoring. \n\nFor dessert, the best came from the Bacon and Egg Cream.  The custard on the bottom was my favorite part, but the chocolate on top and the smokiness really worked well to bring it all together. \n\nThe apple tart was okay.  Doesn't hold a candle to the egg cream.\n\nThe best comparison that I can make for Abe Fisher is Noord.  Both have terrific food, and a similar flavor profile.  Abe Fisher is posh where Noord is warm.  I could use a little, a tiny bit, a morsel of Noord's warmth here, but the food really is outstanding.", "date": "2019-01-29 18:06:52"}

She was very excited to try this spot. With the day almost upon us I asked a coworker how she liked the place. She suggested small plates to share and a pizza. This turned out to be the perfect recipe. \nUpon entering I loved the decor. The whole set up was really cool. I'm a real sucker for rustic things and reclaimed wood though. Also a heated vestibule goes a long way when you show up early. \n\nWe were welcomed in and our coats taken. I absolutely love the look and feel of the place. The only thing that was a little annoying was how loud it was. This had nothing to do with the place or the music. It was just a loud crowd. I think also I'm being a stick in the mud with that complaint. \nSo this is how we did it:\nSome fancy drinks that I did not try so I cannot comment on. I stuck to sparkling water. \nSome Brussels sprout special that was excellent. \nBeet salad: best best salad I've had yet! I wanted another one immediately!\nSpeck and egg pizza: this was amazing. I'm torn between Stella's truffle and egg and this one for best pizza in Philadelphia. We took some home and it was just as god the next day. \nMessinesi: this was delicious and just the right portion since we were already stuffed but wanted to try more things! \nWe finished off with a cheese plate for desert. May sound weird but it was her birthday and that's what she wanted! It was an excellent cheese plate. \nThe service is great and our waiter was more than accommodating. I think if you sneezed with in second waiters would pop up on either side of you. One to bless you and one to offer you a tissue! \nHonestly when the check came it wasn't that severe. Just over $100. You get what you pay for and it was very enjoyable. Also it was her birthday and how could she not be worth it! \nSo if you haven't you really must. Def the nicest place fishtown has. \n\nUpdate: she's my wife now. We took our wedding photos at the hotel and stayed there for a few days after. The hotel is the coolest hotel I've stayed in. It's like we weren't even in Philadelphia. \n\nPhotos by Sharyn Frenkel Photography!", "date": "2018-08-11 03:19:13"}
