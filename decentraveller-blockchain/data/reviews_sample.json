The people in New Orleans tend to have love\/hate relationships with our bridges. Most of us view them as necessary evil at best and are afraid they might fall apart at any moment at worst (the truth is they won't, it's just an irrational fear). The Causeway Bridge is the longest of them all, of course, which seems like it would be the one with the most wear. Actually, it's in amazing shape for a gigantic bridge over a huge lake.\n\nNow the downside: it's freaking long. Looong. Twenty six miles, approximately. That's one hell of a drive with a perfect view of the Lake. And by perfect I mean incredibly boring. If you're a passenger there's nothing to look at. Well, that's not entirely true. The bridge is so long you can witness the curvature of the Earth as the shore you're heading for rises over the horizon. If you're driving into the city from the North shore it's quite a site seeing the large office buildings in that part of Metairie come up on the horizon.\n\nThere is no toll heading north from Metairie but it's a $3 toll for the return trip. It used to be $1.50 each way years ago, I'm not sure why they changed it.","date":"2012-02-16 15:16:33"}

But hey, most folks go for the pizza and it's really good!! \n\n Pro tip: Mondays are $2 domestic pints, so....word to the wise. I highly recommend Noble Roman's, it was a nostalgic part of my childhood and so glad to see actual pizzerias back as a pub. Want pizza? They got you!!","date":"2022-01-02 22:24:49"}

My ribs came out stone cold, not luke warm, cold. Wings came out fine and the chips for the spinach dip were stale.  The manager who was also the cook was told about it and never came out to address the issue. After that, I went into the bathroom and found no soap and no paper towels. I asked to speak to the manager and told him that I was displeased with the issues. He barely mustard up an I'm sorry with no explanation for any of it. After all of that, the bartender comped our food and apologized for his manager. Just my opinion but the gm here on Sunday night is not competent to run a restaurant. We will not be returning for anything other than drinks. I'm pretty upset that I can see Mckenzie grill right down the parking lot and didn't go there. Lesson learned.","date":"2016-06-13 00:09:41"}

I ordered the Sicilian (2 slices) and asked if there was pepperoni on it since I couldn't get a close look. He said yes. However, when it came time to pay , my order was $9 bucks. Apparently he thought I asked if i wanted to ADD pepperoni to it which upped the price $1.5 \n\nAlso it was a bit annoying that the tip option is asked before you complete the transaction on the card reader. Usually most businesses complete the main transaction FIRST, then the tip or ask you to write the tip on the receipt. They give you a plastic cup for the fountain drink and the machine is a Coke centric one. Nothing else to write home.\n\nThe pizza was decent, but not  a revelation.The crust tastes different than many other places. In fact, since I had Jet's sicilian pepperoni just a few weeks ago, I think I like theirs better. Blasphemy, I know to like a chain place over indie , but oh well.

The ambiance is nice, and the limited menu offers some items that stand up nicely to the beers.  For a new brewery I think they are finding their way nicely. The Rhonda and Black Betty are two of my favorites. Last night I had a flight with a Blue Burger and then picked a pint of Rhonda. The burger was very juicy, just the right amount of tang from the blue cheese, but perhaps heavy handed with the mustard.  I am a girl who loves her mustard but that made the burger pretty messy to eat.   There was a side of potato wedges which were cooked well but completely unseasoned. This wouldn't have been an issue if there were s&p on the table.  To be fair, I still ate them all. Two friends ordered the charcuterie board. It had a very generous display, including some blood sausage which was only appreciated by the more adventurous diners, but enjoyed by those. My only other comment is the seating. The tables are beautiful, as are the benches. The benches however are REALLY heavy and only seat two comfortably. If one is sitting already you have to completely stand up to move the seat and get the second person in. The gorgeous benches look like they were an investment so I don't see that changing but its just my observation. If they decide to unload them I would happily take one. The courtyard looks great so I can't wait for DST and warm weather to get out there and enjoy it!  All in all I think this is a great spot and love seeing development on this end of Gallatin Road.","date":"2013-03-02 14:40:46"}

Came for a brunch of sorts - three donuts, coffee and a half chicken for two. The donuts we had were all hot - strawberry lavender, vanilla spice and the honey glazed that came with the chicken. All were fantastic - soooooo good. They are about as big as an Entemans donut and they are indeed light tasting although I'm sure not light in calories. The chicken was also very good - got the dry rub Za'atar which was excellent. Za'atar is dried thyme, oregano, marjoram, or some combination thereof, mixed with toasted sesame seeds, salt and sumac. Great stuff. A couple of the pieces were drier than I'd like and would have been great if there was a dipping sauce. None the less - really liked it although for those who have had Bon Chon this is similar - although I liked the crust on this chicken a lot.

I LOVE Ital Food, proper Rastafarian cuisine, but rarely can find it.  Now I KNOW there are other West Indian people living in Edmonton, so I utilized yelp to find a good place to eat. The searches lead me to this place, Irie Foods, located in Millwoods. Which, from what I can tell from the area, makes sense.\n\nToday the wife (who is Guyanese descent) and myself drop all the way to Millwoods to specifically eat at this place. We live in the NW of Edmonton, so it was a little hop, skip and a jump to the place.\n\nIrie Foods is located in a small plaza strip with businesses like: Servus Credit Union, KFC, 7\/11 Gas Station and a few other places. It is a very quaint\/small place with only a few tables and chairs.  For those of you who might have never visited the Caribbean before, it's vibe\/decor is straight outta the islands. Very basic place with white walls and with generic island advertisements. The front order counter has a display case with many Reggae\/Dancehall\/Soca cds for purchase and has a fridge with a few examples of drinks (Grace Sodas, Coke, Pepsi,etc) They have a single bathroom for men & women to use, please remember to leave the door open after you leave it.\n\nAs for the food, both my wife and I picked the Curry Chicken Roti. It wasn't Ital Food, as Ital Food is typically vegetarian based and contains zero meat. The woman who took our order was VERY nice and greeted us with a smile and nice small talk, during the taking of our order. After she took our order she disappeared to the back, where we saw a man moving around there doing something.\n\nThe wife and I took a seat to wait while the meal was prepared, listening to the music they were playing. At this time two other guys came in and wanted to place an order.  Which they did after the woman returned from the back with our order. We paid and thanked her for the service, as she began to serve the two gentlemen.\n\nWe opted to not sit in the establishment, as it was a nice bright and sunny day. So we picked up a couple drinks and parked across the street in the school parking lot. We figured it was more enjoyable\/private this way, compared to sitting in the place.\n\nThe food comes to you in take-out form, so we broke out the food napkins and began to eat. The roti was more like Jamaican rotis, the major difference is that it comes deconstructed. This means the meat and sauce,etc are not in the actual roti. The roti was rolled up and placed on one side, and the curry chicken roti mixture was placed in a plastic container on the other side. This is different compared to most rotis I have ate, as they have ALWAYS come constructed with the chicken and stuffing inside the roti. ie: like a completely enclosed wrap.\n\nThe food was DELICIOUS though. It came with a deep fried bread ball, which was done perfectly, the coleslaw was also great. The curry chicken tasted amazing and was seasoned perfectly. The roti wraps were standard roti wraps and were tasty.  However my only complaints are: A) Wish there was more curry chicken, B) If the chicken was de-boned and C) wish the curry chicken was actually put INTO the roti wrap and served that way. Especially since we paid $14 per roti, which seems a bit steep for me, but I am sure they have their reasons. Most likely because its a specialty food place and not many people are coming in for the \"exotic food\" option here in Edmonton.\n\nWould I go back to eat there? Only if I was actually in the area for some reason, like going to the movies or going to Edmonton South Common to the outlets,etc. Perhaps their other options on the menu might be better, although I'm not a fan of ox-tail,etc. Maybe if I ask nicely, she could whip me up some good proper ital food. As contrary to the 2010 review by Jennifer P. Irie Foods does not list a single \"ital roti\" on the menu.\n\nHonestly I've been begging my mother to send me a proper roti recipe,etc. Guess I just have to work harder at getting her to send me the info. That or she has to make a bunch and send them to me over night express. That and some of her amazing mac pie.\n\nPS: I find it ironic that in writing this I scroll to the \"Have Additional Tips On This Business\" section and it asks about \"Are these photos helpful\" and it shows how a roti is SUPPOSE to be made and looks nothing like we received. Comical.","date":"2013-07-07 00:30:50"}

It was way too expensive for the job done. At least the woman was friendly, though.","date":"2016-04-13 16:23:53"}

I seen little pieces of onion in it which is probably where most of the flavor is coming from. I like:-) These tacos are great, but they are pretty small for all u really hungry people out there. FYI, u might want to order 1 more from your usual serving. Homemade hot sauce is great . Just the right amount of kick without burning your mouth. \nI loved the tostadas with layered bean, steak, lettuce and queso fresco. 3, which is the serving there, were good enough for me without being overly stuffed . Very flavorful. \nThe cons of this place. \nIt's small, so if you're eating in, by the time u leave you're going to smell like this place from the grilling and frying that's going on. I can still smell this place in my hair and clothes a little bit. \nI don't like the fact that the tacos only have cilantro on them and no raw onion. Maybe, it's because they grill the onion with the meat, but still.. For me, it's not the same as having the raw onion, cilantro and fresh lime on your taco. So, If u want a few sprinkles of raw onion, it's extra. \nLast, a dinky can of soda is $2 which is a ridiculous price. If that's the case I'd rather buy another taco which is the same price .","date":"2014-10-07 00:47:25"}

It was our second time visiting Thai Together. We both ordered off of the lunch menu. I had Red Curry Chicken and he had Red Curry Beef. Each order was $12.50. Very reasonable. Mine came with jasmine rice and he upgraded to coconut rice for $1.25. Both orders came with a veggie spring roll. I just loved my dish. The rich flavours of Thai Curry came through with the perfect amount of spice. I chose the middle spice level of red as I didn't think I could handle the green! There was a nice mixture of veggies in the stir fry. The dish comes plated as a pyramid of sticky rice with the separate bowl of the curry to allow a person to mix as desired. It was a beautifully saucy dish that I will most definitely go back for. The spring roll was hot, fresh and crispy. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the lack of fountain pop. A can of pop is $2.25. I just had water, but if fountain pop was available I would have had that. Overall, a great atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food.

There could have been a little more of the mousse, but that is just quibbling.  My partner, however, ordered the Cobb Salad, which was advertised as having grilled chicken, but had shredded chicken, which was unexpected and disappointing. The breadsticks which were offered in lieu of bread tasted like baked yeast with salt, and some bland olive oil was placed on our table in little saucers to cut the salinity.  The other people at our table were very happy with their food, but another of our party said it wasn't what she expected when she ordered and didn't sound too happy about it.  I don't live in the area so I don't know what restaurants cost there but the prices seemed reasonable, maybe a tad on the high side, but I didn't mind because I was expecting the southern Italian food that I usually encounter.  If I ever find myself in Wilmington again (it is a lovely town and the museum is a jewel) I would gladly return for another meal.","date":"2017-05-10 23:40:12"}

Some are okay, some pretty good, and then some I know I'll be regulars at! Sindoore belongs in the last category - I will probably eat here once a month. Why? LUNCH BUFFET, PEOPLE. I love an Indian lunch buffet - I used to go with dad to a lunch buffet at an Indian restaurant in Dallas growing up and I LOVED IT. Sindoore reminds me of that. The buffet has a lot of choices (vegetarian, chicken, and fish dishes were all available), and everything was good (I had my favorites, though)! A lunch buffet is so amazing, because you can have a little bit of everything. I had two different kinds of chicken, some paneer, some Manchurian baby corn, some lentils, some fish curry, some cabbage, and more! There were also two choices for dessert at the buffet (I got the gulab jamun, which was yuuuuuummy). And they brought a basket of naan! Between my lunch plate and my dessert bowl, I probably tried 10 different dishes from the buffet (small amounts of each), and there wasn't a single thing I didn't like or that I left on my plate or that I ate around. The service was good, and the cafe is small but cute and nice. My buffet with tax and tip was about $14. This is a great deal, especially if you come hungry (I'm going even more hungry next time so I can enjoy the food even more)! All in all? A great lunch. And I'll definitely be repeating it.

Since then I've turned friends and have purchased a few birthday cakes but the last cake I purchased for my best friend's birthday didn't turn out so well... \n\n(1) Her name was spelled wrong. (2) The writing was hideous. (SEE PHOTO! Link above.) \n\nI spoke to Crystal on the phone and spelled out s-a-n-d-y to her and mentioned that it was the usual way to spell that name and she spelled it back s-a-m-b-y and I confirmed it because I clearly misheard. Over the phone, it's not unusual for this type of misunderstanding to occur so I'm not going to blame this on her nor am I going to admit to this as my fault. \n\nWhat I am going to blame them for is how ugly it was written and even the misspelled name was spelled wrong! There was an extra hump in the \"m\" and the \"y\" look like it was an \"s\" which someone then to turned into a \"y.\" And it also looked like that person did a stupid crazy ziz zag design around to try to cover up their foolish mistake. This is the 10in cake (the largest they offer) for $60... not really a cheap cake, huh? I wouldn't expect such an expensive cake to look like this. I couldn't believe they let a cake leave the shop looking like that. \n\nOn the upside... I do love their cupcakes\/cakes because they are so rich! So if you don't like thick cakes, this isn't the place for you. This is the BEST RED VELVET that I've had. I also love their sour cream, chocolate, and marble (hah). Moist and rich. I've had Georgetown red velvet cupcakes and those are also delicious but the consistency is lighter so I wouldn't say that one is better than the other because I have an appreciation for both kinds. Also, I've ordered red velvet with chocolate frosting birthday cakes and they were hits both times so if you really like the rich stuff, try this combo! \n\nDetails ahead but if you don't want to read just make sure that what happened to me doesn't happen to you. I understand that mistakes do happen and I am very upset about this one, which anyone would be, so this is for you all to take precaution to see that no more names are misspelled! \n\nThe story: \nThis isn't the first time I ordered a cake there so I expected it to look nice as my other cakes did. Previously, the text was written in a thicker icing and had no other decoration. Just simple, neat handwriting. This time I got this thin sloppy crap. At two different times, I had friends tell me that Shoprite could've done a better job. \n\nI called back and spoke to Crystal again and she said the best they could do is give me 3 cupcakes. I had to ask them if they would be able to fix it and they said yeah -- mind you I had to bring it up... they didn't offer it. I decided that it was too much of an inconvenience and I didn't have time within the two days before the birthday celebration to go back to NoLib so I fixed it myself. Crystal also mentioned that if they knew the birthday was that far away she could have saran wrapped it. So I originally asked to pick up the cake on Friday but they weren't able to do that and they told me they could have a cake ready for Thursday so I said okay and took that. It's been a while since I've ordered a cake so I've completely forgotten about the saran wrap to ask for it but if it was saran wrapped I probably wouldn't know about the mistake until the day of the birthday which would have been a huge disaster.","date":"2011-08-27 04:12:45"}

I must say I now believe in the healing power of cupcakes, especially ones from Brown Betty.\n\nHonestly, this place wasn't even on my list of places to try because I've been so satisfied with Flying Monkey. But Brown Betty's cakes are a little better and definitely a bit different in style. These cupcakes have a less oily crumb, I feel like the cake could stand on its own better than Flying Monkey's. Also, although the frosting is sweeter, the cake-to-frosting ratio ensures they are not too sweet and are suited to an adult's palate. \n\nThese cupcakes are quite large. I was determined to eat all four of mine before Chad got home and ended up consuming not even a quarter of each. Here's what I had:\n\nRed velvet - excellent and I'm super picky about this type of cake. I could actually taste the cocoa in it, which I was very happy about because red velvet is too often just a vehicle for cream cheese frosting. The cake wasn't too red, which I was grateful for because I try to avoid food coloring. \n\nPineapple - really good if you love pineapple and dislike artificial flavors.  I can honestly describe this cupcake as juicy, in a good way.  \n\nChocolate - I could not believe how much I loved this cupcake. It tasted like it came out of my mother's kitchen! This cake proved to me they bake with love. \n\nSour cream - the surprise favorite. I'm a big fan of yogurt cakes, but I would never have selected a sour cream cupcake on my own. I was impressed with its flavor and moistness, they are definitely using good quality ingredients. Even Bug enjoyed a little of this cake, she showed her appreciation with atomic kitty farts the rest of the night. \n\nI was very, very impressed with my cupcakes.

Some never caught my attention and I've always am looking for a great place. Now every Indian restaurant has its own thing of course. Each place is very unique, some good and some all the same. But I never had a bad restaurant so Indian places are hard to review since they can have their own traditions when it comes to food.\n\nSindoore is a very new restaurant I could tell. So many restaurants come and go and can be hard for Nashvillians to try something new or think all Indian places are the same. Indian people take very big pride in what they offer and it shows in this place. From the moment I walked in I was greeted and sat down. My server was very professional and greeted me. Than she proceeded to ask if I was allergic to anything in foods. That is the first for me and I will say for them to ask is very considerate knowing that Indian food has a lot of spices and ingredients that most can't have. Thank goodness I am not allergic and always willing to try new things.\n\nThis is a low lit place and black out windows but very clean and I will say from the servers to the greeter, they look like they could be a high end restaurant but you can come as you are and still get the great service. This isn't your mom and pops place. So atmosphere is little more professional style. I always like to face the door to watch how people interact, walk in, see how servers treat their guests. I stayed with water and my server brought me I believe is Papadum, a crispy lentil wafer with Cilantro Chutney also known I think as Mint Chutney and Tamarind chutney. Both are a great starters and included with your dining experience. I love the green chutney, I could drink it! I also ask for more to add it to my dishes.\n\nAlso common in Indian cuisine is to have both vegetarian and meat entree. I love meat so I will have to pass on the veggie stuff!\nThe menu is easy to read and each entree has explanation of what you are ordering. They provide also different choices of bread for your meals. There are so many choices but yet not overwhelming and my server was very helpful. \n\nI ordered the Curried Chicken Stir Fry. This specific dish comes with rice, but bread is extra. I did order Onion Kulcha. You also get to choose how hot you want it. When it comes to spices, it can vary on hotness. To cater to most people this is def. one of those places where if you say hot, its medium, if you say medium its mild. So to make sure, I got medium and def. was mild. But it was good enough with a slight kick. For me I like hot foods but I like to taste my food. Next time I'll have to try the hot.\n\nMy server was prompt on filling my water and when the food came out she displayed it nicely on the table. She didn't just throw it at me but put it in front of me nicely displayed for me to reach. I had my rice, my curry, bread and a extra plate to put it together.\nThe first glance of the dish you will first think, wow this isn't much. I def thought that and for what I was paying I wasn't sure if I'd be still hungry. This dish in the end filled me up. In the photo you will see doesn't look like much but it will fill you up. I could see if I was with one other person easily split plus add one more meat dish and share the rest. Eyes can always be bigger than my stomach that's for sure. In this case my eyes were fooled, I was full by the end of my meal and I did eat everything!\n\nThe chicken curry was very full of flavors and really enjoyed it. As I bit into the chicken I could see that it was def. marinated and prepared over time. Most places you bite into a meat, the flavors aren't there. The chicken was tender and the sauce was packed with flavor. I ended up dumping the rice into the meat dish and ate with the spoon. No need for the extra plate! I don't know if this would be considered a \"stir fry.\" It looked like any sauced curry dish. Not many vegetables in the dish or what a stir fry would have.\nThe onion bread of course dipped with sauce and wrapped taco style with the rice and chicken into the bread. \n\nAs I ate I noticed people walking in and a lot of take outs. When you see a diverse group of people coming in and also Indian families coming into eat, means this place will do well. I heard a family next to me say they loved it everything they ate seemed to be a good experience. Every bite they took was, \"oh wow, oh that's good.\" This place has plenty of room for family and even for a single person but they seem to do well for takeouts. There were order after order and people picking up their food. Good sign that all types of people trying this place. One of those hidden gems yet some know where to go!\n\nBack to how I said, Indian people take great pride and this place gave 100%. The dish as $14 and $4 for the bread. So over all under $20 I ate alone and walked out full. I will def be back to try their buffet.","date":"2018-02-14 19:57:27"}

LOVVVVVVE THIS THEATER!!! \nIt's just like the theaters that we had as kids. \nMost of my friends\/followers on here know that I'm a sucker for nostalgia! \nThis theaters gives me all those happy feels! I love it! From the pink neon lights to the gigantic theaters with their huge seats! \nThis theater, and all the Reel Theaters, are amazing. This is hands down, my favorite though.\nSeems a tad bit cleaner than all the others lol. Actually, it's pretty spotless. \nThe lobby is a so big too...big enough that they have tables for people to seat and eat at.\nI dunno, I just love this place.\nAND....movies are only $3 dollhairs! Yes, the movies are new, but they're they old new ones lol.\nThis is kinda like one of the last theaters they show the movies in before they are outta theaters for good.\nI bought a cherry coke (the best soda ever ...and I I never drink soda. Just when I go to a theater\/restaurant, sometimes I get a soda and almost always if they have Cherry coke lol). That being said, I bought a small cherry coke and a box of junior mints. HEY! we are all allowed to cheat once in awhile hahaha! I love Jr. Mints! Especially when they've been in the freezer and this theater offers them that way or regular, boring ass, warm jr mints lol.\nI think I paid like $7 bucks for that lol. Concessions are more than the actual movie, hahaha!\nDoesn't matter tho because this theater is the best. \nThe concessions are still cheaper than Edward's, AMC, Village theaters. \nI know, most of us try to bring in our snacks.\nBut, I couldn't the night I was here. My pants were too tight, hahahahaa! \nI was there on this \"first date\" I was trying to create for this guy and I. We have been chatting for like 4 years, yet have never met lol.\nSo I sent him a text the day before. I KNOW...not enough notice.\nI said \"I'm going for a first moment here for the both of us. Meet me at the cheap theaters by my house, State and Gary Ln. I'm going to see, Star is Born. BUT! do not reply to this text. The moment I'm trying to create is supposed to be like...a romantic first meeting or something like that! Remember, do not respond to this text. If you can't show up, I totally understand! Especially since I'm not giving enough notice\"\n\n....... alas, he didn't show up lol. Sure I was super upset, but at the same time, I wasnt because I told him not to respond. \nI am NOT the romantic type at all...mainly because I suck at it and I have no idea what to do or how to do it lol.\nI thought this was a good attempt tho. Thoughts? Haha!\n\nAnyway, going to see, Star is Born, sure, it sucked sitting alone and every time the door opened, I turned to see if it was Kevin walking in lol.\nHe and I will meet eventually Haha! \nOf course we are still talking :) and again, we will meet. Hopefully on a date lol. It's long overdue. \n\nBut this theater is perfect for stuff like that...IMO.\n\nANYWAY....so if you have never been to a Reel Theater in Boise, you NEED to check one out. The one on State and Gary Ln is the best. Biggest that I've been to, friendly staff, great sized theaters, clean...and HELLO....the memories it brings back for us folks in our late 30's\/40's..\nAgain, I absolutely LOVE and live for stuff that brings back sweet memories from when I was a wee boy and this place delivers and then some.\nI love the past because, life wasn't as complicated as it is now. There was far less hate back then vs today. People back in the 80's and 90's didn't go searching for things to get offended at. \nThere is SO MUCH I could put here, but the theater is supposed to be the focus, Haha! \nAnd it is. Places like that, always make me think of times from back then.\nSure, everyone says life was easier when they were kids. Why? Because we were f**king kids, hahaha! But even older folks these days say that times from when I was a kid...was easier because of so many reasons...some of which I listed above lol.\n\nI tend to take these \"trips down memory lane\" in my reviews, but ya know what, I don't care lol and I can't help it.\nWhen I place like this theater, makes me remember of good times as a kid\/teenager and how life was back then, then that place, this place, gets an A+ in my book.\nSure I visit some places that make me think of the past, and they may be a total shit hole...if that's the case, then they'd get a C- hahaha! \n\nAnyway, thanks, Yelpers! Check this place out\n\nReel Theater, thank you for being so wonderful. Particularly the one I talked about here. We must always have you and your other theaters around. \nIt's such a special place for so many of us, young, older, and old as hell lol.\n\nThanks again!! \n\nCheers, mates!","date":"2019-02-27 21:56:06"}

I don't understand how a restaurant can brew a bad iced tea. Either they're purchasing tea leaves that were harvested in the 1800s, reusing old tea bags, or brewing the tea at an abnormally hot temperature. I'm not a tea aficionado or anything -- I drink Iced Tea from the local QT every morning -- so I'm not holding Beyond Bread to extraordinary standards.

The concept of the place is pretty cool. A nicer pizza restaurant with a bar. Unfortunately it was a total let down.

We waited quite awhile in line but when we got to the counter we were excited when we were told we could sit at the bar. \n\nWe opted to not order a drink at the counter but instead get it at the bar. I personally was very excited for the $5 mimosa they have on Sunday. This was a poor decision on our part because we sat at the bar without service for quite awhile and with nothing to drink. What was frustrating is that the guy at the counter told us we could sit at the bar when we told him that is what we wanted to do. \n\nAs we sat at the bar thirsty, we watched 3 of their TVs that had lacrosse, an old football game from 2010 and sports center in which we could not hear anything they were saying, all while the pacers were playing.  We also watched as meals kept coming out for other people. We got very excited when we finally saw a young lady carry our food out but were let down when she didn't come to the bar to check our number and instead took it back to the front counter. I waited a bit as I watched her move onto the next meal sitting there before I got up and told her that she originally had our meal and we were at the bar. \n\nI went with an Alfredo pizza but asked them to replace the mushrooms with onions and spinach. I also got a side Cesar salad and Tim ordered a deep dish pizza and 6 breadsticks. Once they brought us our food it was easy to see that my pizza still had mushrooms and no spinach on it. It was only once we got our food that the man who appeared to be the manager came to take our drink order. I got the mimosa which was pretty good and Tim got one of the craft beers they had on tap. It was obvious that this guy didn't know much about beer when he asked Tim to repeat his drink a few times and was unable to answer questions by the two guys who sat at the bar after us. \n\nHe ended up walking away before I could even order a water or ask for a fork to eat my salad with so I again had to go up to the front counter to ask for water and a fork. I should have taken the no fork as a sign because the cessation salad was probably the worst Caesar salad I've ever had. \n\nOverall, we were super disappointed by the lack of service, high prices and mediocre food.

This was the second move with Frye's in less than 4 months, and certainly the last.\n\nThe first move was from a house we sold in March, with the bulk of our possessions placed in a local storage facility, and the remaining items moved into our temporary living space at the Metropolitan Apartments in Collingswood. \n\nI knew things were not going to go well when the movers complained they were not going to have enough room on the truck for all of our possessions. I told them this was not possible, because I had parred down the things they had originally moved to storage, by at least 25% since the last move. They said they would have to repack the truck.\n\nLong story short, during the move they broke a large cat tree, Panasonic Plasma TV, a floor lamp, and some glassware. What really concerned me was that I discovered the damages for myself, while apparently, the crew was aware of the damages for some time before my discovery.\n\nWhen I asked the head of the moving crew how I would  be covered for the damages, he said that there is insurance, and I should be covered. He then handed me the final bill, and had placed big X marks on three areas I had to sign, which I did. In spite of the damages, I also tipped the moving crew.\n\nA day later, after much needed rest, I looked at the bill and noticed that one of the areas I was told to sign, Option 1, declined insurance, and\/or increased valuation, and informed me that any damages would be reimbursed at a value of $1 per pound. There was an Option 2 and an Option 3, which enabled me to get more insurance, but was never explained when I was told to sign the bill.\n\nWhen I spoke with Mr. Frye on the phone about a day later, I told him  that even though the original value of the TV was $2000 when I bought it 10 years ago, I just want to be able to replace it with another TV. I thought $300 was fair to cover all damages. He said he would do research and get back to me.\n\nA day or two later, Mr. Frye called and offered approximately $150 to cover the damages, which essentially was a dollar a pound.  I was not happy with this offer, and expressed my displeasure at being coerced into signing Option 1, and not being informed of the other insurance options by the crew when they handed me the bill. In fact, I thought it was rather sleazy to not be told of the options, especially after my discussion with them about my concerns on how the damages would be covered. Mr Frye said he would discuss this with his father and get back to me. \n\nThat was over two weeks ago, and I have heard nothing. I can only assume that Mr. Frye does not have a better offer, and would rather pay me nothing. I hope this review is worth the money you beat me for.","date":"2019-08-14 19:33:53"}

Fat Bottom is in no way perfect but that in no way means you should not visit this place! I feel like it's assets (haha ass-ets, haha fat bottom, see what I did there?) really make up for it's issues. \n\nFirst off, don't let it's peculiar Main Street address, nor it's appearance from the road deceive you, once you head around back you'll descend in to a pretty damn awesome outdoor courtyard and then on your right is the entrance to the brewery's dining room. We sat at the bar as a suggestion by friends and I'm super glad we did. The wood bar was gleaming and really pretty and the stools were the right height. \n\nWe ordered beer - duh - and two blue cheese burgers, also as suggested by our friends. I have to say the blue cheese burger is a contender for best burger in Nashville. They do cook their burgers to order here and they do use really quality ingredients, which the employees are happy to tell you about. I think what constitutes a good burger for me is the presence of sweet, tang, creaminess and texture. In this case the caramelized onions and the blue cheese provided the sweet and the tang, the good quality beef, bread that didn't disintegrate and the creamy aioli really sealed the deal. It's not the best burger I've ever had, Father's Office in Santa Monica will probably always be at the top of my list, but Fat Bottom's is way up there for sure. Only complaint - lose the tomato, useless. They do a fine job with those potato wedges too. \n\nNow I like their beers, I know some people don't - but I'm in the vein of beer drinkers who does not like to feel like I'm drinking a cold pint of grass. A lot of people really like that harshness and Fat Bottoms beer really reminded me of brews from Ladyface Alehouse in Agoura Hills CA. They don't leave some crazy after taste or have an intense stench or a sharp bite. That's my beer preference personally and I think most beer snobs think to be beer snobs, they must like beers with those qualities or they're in danger of liking something like Fat Tire. The horror!\n\nMy only real qualm is with their ventilation. Basically they have none or so it appears. Their tiny kitchen run by what looks two able fellows is literally right next to the bar and the smoke from the flat top bellows out in to the dining room. It was bad enough to visibly see and to sting my boyfriends eyes (although he's sensitive) and it was bad enough that I smelled like burgers after (but is that really a bad thing?). \n\nAnyway I've also heard of service issues here, mostly with forgotten or messed up orders. Also if it were any busier than the night we went, I'm not sure how a two man kitchen could put out food fast enough for the whole dining room. We however had no issues and had an absolutely amazing time and meal. I cannot wait to get back in and try some other tasty menu options!","date":"2013-02-02 01:34:24"}

I like this space for its privacy, especially now during a pandemic. I started out with a Dirty Martini, made with Tito's. The bartender commented that was her favorite drink and I believe her. She made my cocktail so superbly, you'd think she was making it for herself. \n\nFor my dinner, I choose to go with the 10 oz Filet. They prepared it to a delectable medium-rare. Before my filet, I enjoyed a Caesar salad topped with Parmesan cheese and crunchy croutons. I would have liked some fresh cracked pepper, but the freshly ground in the shaker did the trick. As my side, I went with the Green Beans instead of the creamy garlic mashed potatoes that the bartender recommended. The green beans were top notch, they were prepared with bacon and we all know bacon adds that extra flavor. On my next visit, I'll try those garlic rich potatoes. \n\nFor my dessert, I choose the Gooey Butter Cake and had packaged to-go. I was stuffed and had no room to eat it that night.

The Treasure Valley has a TON of wonderful food, but one thing they're still trying to perfect is the Mexican food. Just like everyone else who seems to have already reviewed this place, I am ORIGINALLY from Southern California as well, and feel like I know good Mexican food. This place is decent Mexican food. Here we go:\n\nAfter reading about this place a bunch of Facebook, I've wanted to try it since it's grand opening last week. I mean, if the name of your establishment is literally something like \"California Mexican Food,\" you better live up to the hype. That's like going to a place called \"Maryland Crab Cakes\" or \"Chicago Deep Dish Pizza\" or \"Alabama Fried Butter.\" If you reference what something is known for, make sure it's the best. Cruised over and saw they had a drive thru, which is lovely as I didn't have a lot of time, so I jumped in line and ordered. Two things I always judge a new Mexican place on are their bean and cheese burrito and their carne asada burrito. I ordered those, as well as a \"jumbo\" carnitas taco and a crispy beef taco. Relatively inexpensive for the four items...I think it was like 15 or 16? Went home and busted open the bag. Started with the crispy beef taco. Pretty oily, which I don't mind THAT much if the flavor is there. The flavor was kind of there. I enjoyed it, but not enough to warrant the amount of grease spewing out of it. Next up, the carnitas taco. Not to ruin the rest of this review, but this was my favorite of the items. Was a decent size, good meat, and a lot of freshly chopped ingredients like lettuce, onions, pico, and I think some cilantro. It was tasty...very much enjoyed that one. Next up, carne asada burrito. It....was good. The asada tasted a bit different than what I am used to in a typical carne burrito, as it was, for lack of a better word, wetter than normal. It had an interesting avocado sauce in it that I liked, but probably would have liked better in a different burrito, like some type of dry pork. For instance, I think that sauce would have been PERFECT in a carnitas burrito, but maybe not necessary in the carne version. As for the actual meat, it was seasoned decently, but didn't taste like your typical asada...kind of like it had come out of a stew or something. Still, it was pretty good, but I've had a lot better. Lastly, something that I always judge a Mexican place by, the bean and cheese burrito. The BEST bean and cheese burritos in the world not only use a white, oily cheese that I can't name, but also uses actual LARD in their beans. As far as I know, this place didn't use either. There was a mix of various yellow and white cheeses in there that tasted like one of those Mexican cheese varieties you can by at the store. The beans were...eh. It wasn't bad, but I certainly won't get one of those again. Just not worth it.\n\nOverall, despite the three stars, this place wasn't bad. I am hoping that this feedback might help them out somehow, but it also might not? They are a new business so they might just be having some growing pains, but I do like their location and drive thru. I'll probably be back here at some point because, again, it wasn't bad by any means, but for now, at least for me, it's not something that is leaving me craving more and more.","date":"2020-01-28 16:10:41"}

They said that it would be 15 minutes. After 30 minutes, we called again and they repeated the same thing. After an hour wait. A taxi of theirs came. However someone who was just getting off the ferry jumped in. We stopped the driver and asked him. He told us the name of the person who he was supposed to pick up, wasn't us. Maybe 5 minutes later, another taxi pulls up. Finally ours. We asked the driver how another taxi can pull up for someone else when we had been waiting since 7. He said he didn't know and showed us that he was given our name 20 minutes ago. He proceeded to blame the dispatcher and called her while on the way. She argued with him when answering him and said it was his fault. They kept going on over and over until they finally hung up. We finally made it at our destination at 8:22. When we were ready to pay the driver, he got mad and said we should have told him we had a card, since he was cash only. (Despite the credit card info on the window). Frustrated by this whole experience we called back the dispatcher to see what they could do since we had a horrible experience. We thought a discount or comp was something that was acceptable to ask for considering everything that occurred from their part. Wynette, the dispatcher gave us more attitude. Said all she can do was take our card info over the phone. We didn't want to do that since this place didn't seem so professional. I went to go get cash from home while my boyfriend stayed on the phone with her. When I paid I asked to have her name. She refused to give us her last name but said that she doesn't care we can call the manager and her name is W-Y-N-E-T-T-E. Yes, spelling it out. I unfortunately never called the manager the next day because I didn't have time in the day, only after hours. Hopefully an owner or manager does see this though. (This was 1\/20\/2017 7pm) The dispatcher obviously did an inadequate job and she was extremely rude. People like her will be the reason I will call another establishment.

The menu, probably designed using Power Point, dangles from atop the counter showcasing an assortment of sopes de pollo, tostadas, and burritos... Once your order is in, a lady scoops a mound of tortilla dough (from what looks like a bucket of paint) and pats it flat until it's ready to lay on the cast-iron plancha that has been patiently awaiting the arrival of yet another hungry customer. As the tortillas inflate to their maximum radius, and without taking her eye of the nearby TV, the lady flips them around creating that ideal fluff, that not only perfectly cradles their signature simmered carnitas, but doesn't break as you take that first bite off of your long-anticipated taco.

Luckily none of the food was bad (the service however was terrible), but really nothing stood out as good enough to justify the markup their charging for the experience. We had tried to go to the Pennsport location first, but they closed just as we arrived (3PM closing time seems odd, no?), so we wound up here, and maybe that location is better or something.\n\nDue to their proximity, we wind up with a lot of Philly natives down in DC, and as a result there's this constant bickering about cities, so when 2 different fried chicken and donut places opened up in DC a few years ago there were of course cries of \"idea theft\" from Federal Donut lovers. Well, I can say with a good bit of certainty, that not being from either town (although I do now reside in DC), both operations in DC (Astro and GBD) are a far superior product than what we had from this Federal Donuts. The creative donuts are more creative, and made better, and the chicken is fried better. Whether or not they \"stole\" the idea of combining 2 of the country's most beloved items is absurd, I'm sure many of us did that in our dorm rooms, but ultimately all that matters is the end product, and Federal Donuts falls short in that regard for me.\n\nAs for the donuts, we tried the blackberry walnut, marshmallow squared, and chocolate glazed, along with one of their \"fresh\" made basic donuts, since Suzy isn't really into the fancy flavors. The cake consistency of each of the fancy donuts was well done, but they all just tasted kind of plain. I believe they just use the same cake batter for almost everything and then simply dip it in whatever the flavor is, rather than baking the flavor into the mix. This results in somewhat of a Dunkin Donuts feel to the product, at a much higher premium. The guy doing the fresh donuts was having a good bit of trouble actually making a circle, so Suzy had to keep going back repeatedly to check for her donut (we were literally the only non-employees in the building at the time). Coupled with the fact that he seemed to have a good bit of difficulty answering any questions she had about the menu items, this left us even less impressed with the staff than the actual food.\n\nThe fried chicken was somewhat better than the donuts in terms of execution. We chose one dry option and one glazed, and I'm fairly certain I wound up consuming the lion's share of it all (no surprise to anyone who knows my background). The za'atar seasoning was nice and heavy on the chicken, adding lots of flavor, but the chicken itself was a bit too dry. The chili garlic was somewhat excessive, I would prefer to not need an entire roll of paper towels to make through an order of 6 wings. It was hard to get a feel for the chicken itself when you're having to scrape off giant chunks of sauce. It just felt sloppily composed, or just lazily executed. It was nice they include a basic donut with each order, to give you something to balance the flavors, but would have been even nicer if it mentioned that on the menu so that we could have adjusted our donut order accordingly.\n\nI don't recall exactly what our total for a few donuts and a dozen wings (and maybe a soda and a water) was, but it was somewhere between $30-40, which is fairly ridiculous considering the simple approach to everything. If they were huge yeast donuts (like at Doughnut Plant, VooDoo, or GBD) then maybe I could understand, but these donuts lack that level of effort. To top it off their register has one of those annoying \"tip screens\" that you have to go through before signing for your credit card purchase. You basically have the same job as someone at KFC, and expect a tip for it, on top of your already overpriced product. Get out of here with that nonsense.","date":"2015-01-09 14:42:02"}

I ordered a square cake which is easier to cut and serves more therefore costing more yet I was given a round cake. I was also given the wrong flavor cake and the wrong flavor icing then what I'd ordered, and last but not least the writing on the cake looked like a three-year-old wrote it and the decorations were comical. It was embarrassing. And then to boot, The cake tasted old and dry. When I called and complained I was offered three free cupcakes. REALLY???? The cake was well over $100. Dropping in for three free cupcakes was not even worth my time.

Tender and just a little crisp around the edges. The tripe I was worried about because I have never had it this way before, but gave it a go. I loved it. I loved every mouthful, especially with the spicy green sauce I don't even know the name of. It was a little fatty a little crunchy, the flavor was clean and fresh. I highly recommend it!

No one should be anywhere at this hour, but I get dropped off in front of Beyond Bread, where my plan is to inhale something while waiting for Bookmans to open.  I had looked over the menu online the night before, and had an idea of what I wanted.  I'm from out of town, never been here before, don't know how things work, serving time at a minimum-security forced labor camp and had the morning off for good behavior.  I'm barely awake and approach the counter in a fog with my belt unbuckled and my fly in an indeterminate state.  I tell the guy that I'd like the breakfast sandwich thing.  He asks me how I would like it.  Not able to process the question, I say: \"Can I have it with everything?\"  He says no, but would I like to start with the choice of bread?  I ask what they have, not able to focus on the racks of bread immediately behind him.  He gestures to the clearly labeled racks that now seem embarrassingly apparent.   In my only truly decisive move of the ordering process, I ask for Rye.  Odorous, deep, dark, rich Rye with hair on it.  No effeminate marble rye for me.  Now a cheese.  I don't care.  I go for Provolone.  How about tomatoes, onions or jalapenos?  Now I ask again: \"Can I have everything of those?\"  He says yes.  Thank goodness.  \"And coffee please.\" I mutter.  \"Would you like a paper cup or a mug?\"  I ask for a mug, as I plan on sitting around for a while.  But then it occurred to me that maybe I was actually buying the mug itself with the coffee.  I don't know.  I'm not from around here and just escaped from a mental institution in Seattle where you can actually be forced to buy a mug.  What do I know?  I ask the guy if I am buying the mug itself, and he says no with a puzzled look.  I want to tell him that I am from this planet, but he already seems dubious.  I roll the bill on my credit card but didn't notice the candlestick-looking thing with a sign on it that was placed in front of me.  As I start walking away with my receipt, he reminds me gently to take this with me to my table.  I get it.  Someone will bring the order to my table.  \n\nI self-serve some coffee from a pump-thermos thingy and sheepishly head off to a corner where I unsheathe my book and try to disappear.  The coffee is gooood.  Much better than the coffee served across the street by the contemptible Seattle pushers of coffee-flavored milk beverages.  My order arrives in a few minutes.  Thick slabs of rye with chewy crusts.  In between are a nicely cooked template-formed omelet and the tomato, cheese, onion and jalapenos, along with the potatoes.  An excellent, substantial breakfast at a reasonable price.   I'll have to try lunch sometime when I can get work release.  Clean bathrooms.  The Pima County Health Department has consistently given this place the top E for Excellent rating since 2005.","date":"2009-03-23 01:44:56"}

Anyway, found the last parking space and went inside. Greeted by 3 very bored and unhappy looking teens at the front, one of whom asked me how many. I replied \"two\" and one of them walked off after we THOUGHT we heard her mumble \"follow me\". Apparently we misheard, because she walked over to the very opposite side of the floor and sat down to do some prep work. Confused at this point, we seated ourselves at a clean table in the middle of the floor where we were sure not to be missed. After a couple of minutes, a busboy saw us and looked over at the bored teen crew at the front door and gave a \"WTF\" arm raise and shrug. I assumed at that point someone would be over, but it took a server walking by about 5 minutes later to state \"be with you folks in a sec\". He (the server) is the only reason for 4 stars. The wings were good, of course, and the atmosphere was decent considering it was a Saturday and playoffs. All in all, not a bad visit, but it could have very easily been less than it was. \n\nTips--the wings are, like, Fucillo HUUUUUUGE!!! So be prepared to either leave stuffed or take some home if you order more than 6. \nTheir bleu cheese dressing is very good at taking the bite out of any hot wings you get, so keep that in mind in case you overstep trying to be all macho and stuff. \nThe sweet tea is decent, but not \"southern sweet\", so if you're a transplant, you'll be fine. They have all-day $5 \"homerun\" margaritas, so there's that.\nIf you go before dark, you're likely to encounter some families (with young ones), so plan accordingly.\n\nEdit to add servers name \"Joshua M\"","date":"2018-04-28 21:13:11"}

Their breakfast sandwiches and omelets are really delicious, and the potato pancake sides are fantastic! Still awesome sweet pastries, too (my faves: the nutty sticky buns and the fruit tart). I know they're mostly famous for their lunch sandwiches, but I think breakfast is where it's at. While the lunch menu is creative and filling, it'll run you around $9 if you stick with water. The vinegar slaw with jicama is the side to go with. \nI guess my only complaint is that their crusty, homey bread shreds my upper palatte, especially with the toasted sammies.

I have used the Doggy Spa for several years and know the owner Dan who is an absolute animal lover and has the passion and love for our Angels as I do but most of all giving the client Peace of Mind in knowing your pet will be safe and well treated. I highly recommend using his hair cutting services and his daycare overnight services. He is a good man and has great staff. I just took my 2 dogs Francis and Brie for their haircuts yesterday and omg how adorable they came out and wow they did not come to us right away instead they ran over to say good bye to the staff and Francis kinda a flirt went over to say high to a special female staff member who he really liked then eventually said hi to us That made me happy because I know they were loved there seeing them say good bye to staff. People need to realize one thing pets getting their hair done can be a stressful time for them so it's important the staff know how to treat them. Of course there will be moments when people are loud or dogs act out that is part of the business and Dan makes sure his staff are in control and professional but most of all taking all measures possible to be safe for both staff and clients pets. I do not go to anyone else and I am in the business so he is my competition and I go to him.","date":"2018-05-31 12:32:36"}

Their menu is not the most diverse out there, but sometimes less is more when you want to be in and out quickly without agonizing over three or four pages of options.\n\nI'll say right off the bat that this place is pricey: $2.50 per doughnut and almost $10 for four pieces of chicken. That said, the chicken is moist, tender and juicy with a perfectly satisfying crunch. You have several choices of dry and glazed flavorings; we went with honey ginger (glaze) and buttermilk ranch (dry). Both were great but I especially liked honey ginger.\n\nThe doughnuts left me a bit underwhelmed. I tend to dislike cake doughnuts to begin with, so that may factor into my opinion. I tried grapefruit brûlée and lemon ricotta. The first was definitely the better of the two, slightly more tart than sweet but still good. The glaze tasted a bit burnt towards the middle but this didn't bother me since it was minimal. The lemon, on the other hand, didn't taste much like lemon (just sweet) and there was zero evidence of ricotta.\n\nBased on the expense, I wouldn't make this place a habit, but it's certainly a nice spot to drop by for a quick lunch and some sweets.","date":"2015-08-24 19:32:01"}

We came to check out the different areas so we stopped by Fat Bottom Brewing since my friend loves beer. I have to admit that I am not a big beer fan. I tend to like girlier drinks such as margaritas but decided to still go along with the flow. I think we went in the back entrance or maybe that is the front? I am not sure. That is the only confusing part of this place. We walked through the brewing area to get to the taproom part. \n\nOnce we got in and sat down someone came to get our drink order. Even though this is a brewery I can't really fully comment on the beers but my friend ordered the sampler, I tried a few sips of each and they were all good. He really enjoyed them. I know he has been back since moving. \n\nOur food came out in waves which was weird but didn't bother me since I know it isn't a traditional restaurant. I ordered a burger which was a better version of a big mac. The burger was excellent! Not what I expected from a brewery that specializes in beer and not food. The fries were also excellent. My friend ordered a kale salad and said he loved it. My sister and brother in law ordered side items and they raved about how good everything was. All of us agreed that we didn't expect it to be so good but that we would all return again. We were all impressed.","date":"2014-05-12 18:14:57"}

The place is gorgeous inside, but was hard for both of us to find a beer we liked.  The menu was also very limited.  We didn't try the food because we could not find a beer we wanted to linger over.\nRecently I had been reading some nice things about the food and found that they had added a few new and different beers, so I insisted on giving them another try.  I am glad we did!\nThey now have an Ida Golden Ale which I love.  My husband tried the ginger beer.  We sat at the bar and had an amazing bartender.  The food menu had definitely grown and there were daily specials posted on the chalkboard.  We thought we would try the special cucumber buratta salad consisting of spiralized cucumber dressed in a light dressing, and topped with delicious creamy buratta.  Sandy Madewell, the chef, came out and chatted with us as well.  We ordered the hummus after, and enjoyed it too!  The GM, John Lawless came out and was friendly and informative. Unfortunately,  they will be leaving East Nashville for the west side.  They plan on having a much larger menu and the space will be larger too.  I hate that we waited too long to try it again\n  Guess we will have to pay a little more for a Lyft now....","date":"2016-08-27 23:02:11"}

This place is a hole-in-wall in every sense of the word and like many other hole-in-the wall places, I would have never discovered this place if it wasn't for yelp. Its located in a Mexican Grocery store on McDill in the corner of a small plaza. When you walk in, you might want to immediately walk out because it just seems to congested and small...but DONT. lol \n\nThis place has delicious, authentic, rapidly made tacos that range from about $1.75 to 2.25 as well as quesadillas, sopas, soups and several other small items. I've only had their tacos which are so flavorful! I typically order 4 tacos: carnitas, al pastor, pollo and fajita- which comes out to $8. I usually get full after 3 because they are pretty packed with the filling. I typically order it to go and it is ready in about 15 mins. Recently, I dined in and loved the experience. The waitress was super sweet and helpful, the food came out very quickly and eating the tacos fresh out of the kitchen (rather than waiting till I get home) made the tacos taste even better. \n\nIf you want something cool and sweet to eat after the tacos I highly recommend the Mexican ice cream bars sold at the store. Its found in the cooler slightly diagonal from the checkout place. They are so sweet and the perfect treat after the spicy tacos. My favorite flavor so far is the coconut pineapple. It tastes like a Pina Colada with flakes of coconut throughout. \n\nIf you're in the area and craving tacos....this is THE place to go. There are several other taco places in the same area but I'm pretty sure this is the best. :)","date":"2016-04-10 20:41:39"}

Located on Main Street in East Nashville, it's easy to get to, although parking seemed like it could be an issue.\n\nMy first visit happened to be through Girls' Pint Out, which is starting a chapter in Nashville - yay - and only four weeks after the brewery opened. So, my experience was maybe a little different than other visitors, but still worth a review.\n\nFirst of all, the brewery is a startup if I ever heard of one - the owner\/founder has been brewing his own beer for ten years (although he's a very young guy still - case in point: he had his infant with him later in the evening) and he just adores it. I applaud him for taking a leap of faith and starting his own brewery (like so many dream of) and can't wait to continue supporting his beer venture. The rest of the staff were awesome - welcoming, amiable, knowledgeable, and patient. I give them two thumbs-up.\n\nThe patio area, although it could use some larger picnic tables for larger groups, was perfect for an evening with 70-degree weather. Note: you can enter from the back alley into the patio directly if you are parked back there. A large group of cyclists showed up around the time we left to enjoy beers together in the outdoor courtyard.\n\nInside, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. For only having been open for four weeks, there were a good number of people there. The taproom is open Tuesday through Sunday from 4-10 (don't quote me on the Sunday) and 2-10 on Saturdays. Tours are offered on Saturday and Sunday (I think that's right), unless the owner is brewing.\n\nThe beers were delicious - the selection isn't huge, but come on, they just opened. There was a red ale, a stout, an IPA and a wheat beer available when we went. The porter is on its way in the near future. The owner adores pale ales, but decided to skip on creating a pale ale at the beginning since \"everyone does a pale ale.\" I tried the red ale and the stout and enjoyed both.\n\nAlthough I didn't try the food, I saw a burger and the cheese plate come out - I would easily try both next time I'm there. Yum.\n\nTips: Get a flight to try all the beers in one visit. Talk up the owner if he's there to learn about the brewery and how he chose the name (hint: it's not based ona Queen song!). Arrive early to park if you're coming with a large group.\n\nIn the end, I can't wait to return to Fat Bottom Brewery with friends. A great addition to East Nashville and the Nashville beer scene.","date":"2012-09-20 13:41:22"}

I received both green and red salsa on the side but my mouth and stomach were so preset to taste Mexican sabor that stopping to dip the tortillas in them would have been slow torture. \nThe flavor was very smooth and full.

After 10 minutes we asked again where the food was.  She said that she would put a rush on it which tells us that they never started the meal which should take under 5 minutes to cook considering that it was just an omlette and a ceasar salad (which doesn't require cooking).\n\nAfter that, we just left.  The guy at the counter still made us pay the bill for what we ate and said that if we came back that he would give us a free drink instead of just comping us for the meal.  He had told us that the waitress forgot to give the order to the cook due to the apparently extremely large party of 15 people that was there.\n\nWhen he said that about the \"free\" drink which was watered down and had very little alcohol in it, he had a smirk on his face that made me wish my step-father was there so that he could tell the man off.  My feeling was that they did not want to have us there for some reason.

Actually the line is City Ave. (Route 1) and these folks are just off the Bala Cynwyd side.  On the other side of City Ave. is Philly so many folks in the burbs like this place because they don't need to drive into the city.  Folks in the city find it very easy to find.  \n\nSecond, I've had much different lunch vs. dinner experiences here.  I've enjoyed lunch here many times.  The ambiance here is typical steakhouse.  It's not as over-the-top as Union Trust or B&S but it is still very nice.  The wait staff is exceptional.  The Blackened Steak Salad with Asparagus, Tomato, Red Onion, and Ranch Dressing has always been amazing.  How about Cajun Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes?  It's very good.  Want a cheesesteak?  Here you order Filet Mignon Cheese Steak with Cipollini Onions, Mushrooms and Blue Cheese French fries.  Expect large portions and steakhouse prices.  This is a four (4) star lunch experience.  If you are in the area and have the cash I would recommend it in a heartbeat.\n\nThis is also a great place for a happy hour drink and very popular with the local business folks.  The bar itself is beautiful and the bartenders are competent and full of personality.  Finally the drinks are potent.  Once again this is a four (4) star experience.\n\nUnfortunately these folks let me down a bit for dinner.  The price point here is the same as the downtown steakhouses so it's only fair to compare to them.  When I'm paying that kind of cash I expect a four (4) stars + experience.  Don't get me wrong, my dinners have been fine here but fine doesn't cut it when I can drop the same amount of cash at Union Trust and have a great or even exceptional experience.  It's the little things that add up that bring the meal down.  A salad that tastes good but looks hastily thrown together.  Maybe my steak is a little dry.  Or maybe a side dish temperature is off.  For dinner I need to go three (3) stars and as most folks probably read these reviews for dinner choices my overall rating needs to be three(3).","date":"2012-02-14 15:26:14"}

This area of MacDade boulevard has seen many restaurants come and go.\n\nI hope this one is here to stay.\n\nWe sat as a party of 8 -- taking up much of the front seating area -- but didn't feel squashed.\n\nWith so many choices to pick from, my wife and I settled on crab nachos and hushpuppies for appetizers.  I had the South Philly crab gravy.  My wife had the pappy pot.\n\nOh, yeah, where to start,  I'll start at the beginning.  It's as good a place as any.\n\nSoda (at least from the fountain) is New Hope -- pretty generic, cola, lemon lime, etc.  But, considering the very interesting tact of nothing here having high fructose corn syrup in it, it's perfectly acceptable, and downright tasty.  I ended up with a bottle of Pepsi Throwback -- one of my favorites.\n\nThe Crab Nachos -- insane.  Good amounts of crab, some diced jalapenos, guac, sour cream, cheese...  This was a meal by itself.  After polishing off half of this platter (and a few of my wife's hushpuppies -- which were also pretty good -- ask for some maple syrup to dip them in... Don't laugh until you try it!) my platter arrived.\n\nThis was a huge portion of linguine, with crab meat and chunks of tomato in the sauce.  Yeah, sauce.  I'm Irish.  Sorry.  To crown it, a cleaned crab sat on top.\n\nWow.  For $16, this had to be the meal (and bargain) of a lifetime.  I'll return just for this meal.  The sauce wasn't watery, the crab was firm and sweet.  Wow.  Just wow.\n\nDid I mention wow?  My meal came with a salad, which was pretty typical.  A salad.  Lettuce.  Tomato chunks.  Some onions.  Cucumber.  Ranch dressing.  It was a salad.  There's no way it could compare to my pasta. :)\n\nMy wifes crab pot was mostly devoured -- she had to take some home for lunch the next day.  Again, the crabs were cleaned, firm, and sweet.  If I had to guess, they were #1 males -- not exactly the low end of the crab totem pole -- and there was plenty of meat.  No scrawny crabs here.\n\nThere were a bunch of desserts, but there was no way we'd have had room for any.\n\nI hope to return here again.  And again.  And again.  Just hope it manages to break that mid-MacDade mojo that seems to have doomed so many other places here.  I think it has the stuff -- so give it a shot!\n\nSo, yeah, Steve... I'll give it a 5.","date":"2012-10-21 21:03:11"}

The joint has a great vibe, after you convince yourself that they are indeed open, despite the fact the front door leads into an empty room full of beer brewing equipment.\n\nAfter working your way through the expansive, mostly empty, space you reach a door that opens into a room that rings with the vibe of the Pacific Northwest. Wood abounds, from the benches, chairs, tables and bar. Richly lacquered timber tabletops and recycled pallet wood walls creates a charming blend of new and old that seems the latest trend using upcycled materials.\n\nStill sporting the logos outside of the old Fluffo Mattress Co., this place contains all the charm you might expect from a place that embraces the old while making something new. I never made it outside to the patio, which I hear is one of the more charming features, but I was there to drink a beer with a few friends, so I didn't tour the place.\n\nI started with a sampler flyte, as I do at every micro-brew joint I visit. They had a small but good selection of beers, leaning to the darker side, which I really appreciate. Here is what I had:\n\nFirst up, the Ginger American Wheat Ale, which is just about a light as I can imagine anyone ever wanting a beer. It was a very subtle and mild beer and I could just make out a touch of ginger. It was one of my least favorite beers on tap, I definitely think it could use a little more body and a touch more ginger.\n\nNext in the line was what I thought they called Black Betty IPA on the menu, but they call Black Betty India Black Ale on the website. I may not be that educated on the technicalities of beer classification, but there was nothing Pale about that ale. Typically, I am not a fan of IPAs, as I don't like hopsy beers, but this is where the difference between a P and a B is huge. I really enjoyed the burnt malt flavoring of the Black Ale, it worked really nicely with the bitterness of the hops. This is probably my favorite variation of an IPA that I've ever tried.\n\nThe night I was there, they were out of their Ruby Red American Ale, and I don't remember what they replaced it with. I want to say it was an IPA of some sort, but I really don't remember. I look forward to trying Ruby Red on a future visit.\n\nNext up was Bertha Oatmeal Stout. I'm generally a stout drinker, so I expected this beer to be my favorire. It had a nice body and was really smooth, but up popped my little enemy-- hops-- to give it a slightly bitter finish that took away a little of it for me. Still, I really enjoyed this beer and imagine drinking some pints of it in the future.\n\nLast on the flyte was the Java Jane Coffee Porter, my least favorite beer. It tasted like someone took a cup of coffe and topped it up with a Guinness. The coffee flavor overpowers any of the other ingredients of the beer. I think the brewers are well aware of this, as they suggest using this beer as an ice cream float... something I'd be willing to try, but not because of its characteristics as a beer, but its characteristics as a coffee beverage.\n\nOverall, my experience with the beers were good, but much like it's near by competitor The Pharmacy, it really lacks as a beer joint because of it's lack of reasonable appetizers. Everything on the menu is $8-10 and is meal heavy and not very shareable. One member of our party discovered you can order a side of potato wedges for ~$3, but that option isn't listed on the menu. \n\nI know it makes more business sense to only offer entrees, but for the budget minded person, it makes me more inclined to stop by to fill up a growler and have friends to the house were we can eat something less than a meal. But then again, since their closing time is 10pm, they aren't really going for a bar crowd and aiming more for the dinner and lunch crowd.\n\nSince I didn't get over there until close to 9PM for drinks, my experience was limited. I look forward to going again sometime soon when I can try some of the food and perhaps experience the patio.\n\nOverall, my experience was good, and I think Fat Bottom is a great addition to East Nashville. While I may not become a regular, I'll definitely be going there again.","date":"2012-10-24 15:24:20"}

They are inventive and their cupcakes taste every bit as good as they look. I've taken countless visitors to Brown Betty and most of them request a return visit every time they come back to town.\n\nPineapple is my fav, but the Red Velvet are a VERY close second. As mentioned by the misguided reveiwer before me Brown Betty will close early if and when they sell out, and they WILL sell out of the goodness. This is common practice at any quality bakery, since baked goods made sans crap ingredients start to decline in freshness the moment they are cool and ready for eating. I suggest stopping at Brown Betty to make a purchase early in the day, you'll be glad you did. Besides BB cupcakes taste better at room temp anyway.","date":"2010-05-17 01:39:25"}

I've been eating their sandwiches since my college days (2005 on).  Their menu, full of variety, offers something for everyone's personal taste buds.  After selecting one of the many items of the many, next comes choosing from their large selection of freshly made breads.  Any kind of bread you want - don't worry, they have it.  \n\nLately, my selection has been the Plain Jane (watching the holiday weight and all).  But Plain Jane isn't exactly plain.  The sandwich, comes on your choice of bread (remember, there are tons to choose from), and is absolutely piled high with turkey, lettuce, sprouts, tomato, onion, two slices of cheese, a light spread of mayo and honey mustard.  Not being a fan of honey mustard, I go sans mustard.  The sandwich is so large that most people can't get their mouth around it.  The turkey - is quality turkey, not same ole deli-turkey.  Sliced, full of flavor, fresh - just like it was recently carved off a turkey.  Yummm!\n\nEach sandwich comes with your choice of chips, baked chips, or carrots.  For a small additional cost, one can add pasta salad, soup, small green salad, or fat free vinegar slaw.\n\nSome of their sandwiches may be slightly pricey, but the size of the sandwich really makes up for it.   Also, there's always the option to just go with a half sandwich, which still includes the side offerings.  \n\nI' ve enjoyed this sandwich place for a while now and just like so many college memories, it will always have a special place in my heart.","date":"2010-12-27 20:09:50"}

I have talked with Alli, and she was gracious in explaining every one has a different outcome. Since our conversation, I utilized rubbing alcohol on the facial area, and since peeling has started...around the mouth area...although I was expecting a better outcome, it is not the fault of this institution. I believe the product itself was less effective than a  glycolic peel treatment, and personally would not bother with this \"banana peel\" procedure, but look for something with heavier strength that will tighten the skin, remove sun spots or freckles and help produce collegian.","date":"2012-10-01 14:33:50"}

I don't know if they changed chefs recently or not, but the last two times we've been there, the food has been nearly inedible. On my last visit, which was Friday night, I got a buffalo chicken wrap. The chicken inside was fried, yet icy cold. Not cold like it had sat out too long; cold like it had been in the fridge for hours. The fried coating was soggy and there was no actual buffalo sauce on the chicken. It had sunk into the coating and merged with it during the time it had been sitting around. My friend ordered a Boca burger and it came out pale yellow in color. The waitress explained it was a \"turkey\" Boca burger. Gross! Who wants a fake turkey burger? When a vegetarian orders a veggie burger they generally assume it will somewhat resemble an actual burger. The fries were also soggy and not very hot. The nachos tasted oddly bitter and they used chips that did not have any salt on them. The previous time we had gone, my fajitas were so bland I could barely eat them. I had to beg for hot sauce to give them any kind of flavor whatsoever. Oh, and we had to eat dinner while listening to blaring loud heavy metal music and freezing to death; the manager refused to turn on the heat. This place is going to be in trouble if they don't pay attention to the bad reviews and do something to turn themselves around.","date":"2013-04-14 19:26:59"}

One of the worst servers I have ever had. Very unknowledgable and completely unprofessional. We sat at our table for a good 15 minutes before he even came over and took our drink order. Marcus couldn't tell us the drink specials and when he asked for our ids he looked at my friends id and said \"oh okay you're 22\" her birth year is 1992 I don't see how you get 22 out of that and when he asked my boyfriend for his id he looked at the date and said \"I don't know that date\" and proceeded to serve him alcohol anyways. After 25 minutes of sitting there with no drinks or anything he finally brings out my boyfriends drinks. We sat at the table waiting for a good 40 minutes and my friend and I still had no drinks so I got up and asked the manager to seat us somewhere else. We then sat with a server with dreads who was slightly better but we still had no drinks for a good hour. We were at the restaurant for a total of 2 hours when every other time I've been to this location or any chili's for that matter we're done and out the door within 30-45 minutes. The manager came to talk to us at the end of our meal and asked what all happened and then told us they were having trouble with this server. We received no apology and he didn't offer us any kind of compensation or anything. I've worked at a restaurant so I know at what point you are supposed to greet your table and have drinks at the table and when a server screws up we always offered to comp something off the bill or offered a free dessert.

Once we looked at the menu and were able to get our sever back over, we placed our order.     We ordered the Charcuterie & Cheese and an order of wings both of which were excellent.

I'm in Pinellas, and the great reviews of Acapulco made this a must-see taco stop.  Acapulco has just a few tables (~6?) with some bar stools for counter eating, and the incredible cook speaks broken, but adequate, English to facilitate ordering at the counter.  It's a fairly limited menu, but who cares when the food is this great.   Good selection of choices though with 9 kinds of tacos:  lengua, al pastor, carnitas, sesina\/beef steak, pollo, tripa, buche, fajita and taco de pollo frito  (chicken fried taco, one kind not often seen in Tampa area taquerias).   Also sopes, huaraches and 4 soups (menudo Sat-Sun only).\n\nMy guest and I ordered up some tacos....al pastor, beef and a couple of carnitas.  If short order our tacos arrived at our table along with a nice big bowl of limes (a nice touch) and salsa roja (didn't see the salsa verde mentioned by another reviewer but I'll definitely have to ask for it on my next visit).  Not sure if they roast the peppers for the salsa, but it tasted like it as it had a great deep pepper flavor and nice medium heat.  Of course, hand made corn tortillas are required for great authentic tacos and these were delicious, steaming hot (I had to use a paper towel just to hold my first taco) and just the right thickness to use a single tortilla (I had actually ordered double tortillas, but the 2 tortillas seemed to overtake the great meat, onion and cilantro flavors, so I quickly ditched the outer and used it to eat the stray meats that spilled out).\n\nAll the meats were moist, the steak was tasty, the rich al pastor was moist with all the flavors melding together so well, and the carnitas were fantastic....hunks of moist pulled pork that had been grilled just before serving to give the meat a nice texture, with the outside edges almost lightly crunchy in a great way.  Few taquerias in the Tampa area do carnitas this well (or al pastor, for that matter).\n\nUnfortunately we were in a hurry to get to an appointment so we couldn't stay for seconds, but that just means I'll have to come back soon.

I ordered the sizzling fajitas and the tortillas were so hard and dry that I could've tossed one like a frisbee through the window.

They don't have it.  This is the lack of selection I expect from a subways but not from this size of an independent eatery.\n\nI would like to have been able to recommend a locally-owned place like this but like I said, it sucks the market away from traditional delis where you can order what you want.  Perhaps I feel a bit bitter after buying two sandwiches for the price of four ($17!).

Split a dry rub chicken (order comes with free honey donut) and 2 regular donuts (strawberry lavender and cinnamon sugars.  The \"regular\" ones are made to order and come out warm and soft.  The \"fancy\" ones are about a dollar more expensive and come in more flavor varieties.  First time I visited, my son and I were originally planning to pick up and go. We ended up staying and finishing the whole thing on the spot.  The chicken was perfect balance of crisp, slightly battered skin and juicy meat.  The free honey donut didn't do it for me but the combination of it with the fried chicken made sense.  The 2 warm ones felt light even tho they were cake donuts and felt like they melted in our mouths.\n\nThe only bad parts of our otherwise great experience were: (1) I didn't realize one of my donuts was missing until I was already an hour out of the city; (2) the fancy one\/burnt caramel I ordered was only 1 of 3 flavors left at around 4pm.  \n\nGood news was that I found myself back in philly the next day and swung through again.  It gave me an excuse to get more warm regular donuts.  Plus, even though the same cashier wasn't working and because they were out of the flavor I had previously ordered, I was given 2 free donuts for my trouble in addition to the 2 additional I bought.

These tacos normally just come with a little cilantro sprinkled on the top, no onion. I, as u can see told them to put whatever their everything was. Still, $16 is a bit steep in my opinion considering the size. Maybe, it was the drink. Maybe, it was the toppings. I don't know what it was, doesn't matter now I guess, all I know is that these tacos were definitely the best yet that I've had in any of these Mexican places here in Clearwater, and there is quite a handful here. Usually, when I come to these type of places I get one of each meat to taste .. beef, pork, & chicken and there is usually only one meat that stands out and the others lack flavor, but both the chicken and the beef were delicious. The meat was seasoned really well, I couldn't decide which one I liked better. The fresh handmade corn tortillas really made the taco, and they did not break when u picked them up. I was really hungry and I hadn't ate all day so I took 6 down with no problems. I swear I'm not a pig, the tacos are small, and look bigger in the pic. ;-) I could have did without the last one and I would've been good. I'd be good with 4 on a not so starving day. The only reason i gave a 4 and not a 5 is because the ladies in there are not the friendliest. It's ok though, I can block them out for a good taco.

From there the staff could not have been more  caring and helpful. They were excellent. They responded to my moms every need and treated her like they would their own mom.

When I went to pick her up I was informed that she was moved to a basic kennel that appeared to be for stray animals because they could not handle her. She was cowering in her bed and didn't move until I went to grab her. When I picked her up I realized how stressed and thin she had gotten.

When I took her home she devoured a bowl of fresh food and drank a bowl of water ! I understand that dogs get stressed but she has been boarded before without problems.

It didn't disappoint in the least. This is the real deal when it comes to tacos and authenticity of their tortillas. I had two soft corn tacos with carnitas\/pork filling and it is amazing that this was only 3 dollars ($1.50 each). The tacos had plenty of filling and were lightly topped with cilantro, a cup of very mild but tasty red sauce and lime wedges. What seals the deal are the freshly pressed tortillas. The cooks behind the counter were pressing them as the orders came in and you could smell their delicious smoky warm corn aroma the moment you stepped inside.  I ordered \"una libra para llevar\" (1 pound to go-- only $2!), and look forward to making some soy tacos tonight for dinner. Whatever you can come up with at home and put inside of these is bound to be enhanced greatly because they are so yummy and good. Just a note they are cash only, so be prepared and visit and ATM prior to going. \n\nNow I only need to figure out how to not be tempted by this place since it is about 1 mile away from my work.
